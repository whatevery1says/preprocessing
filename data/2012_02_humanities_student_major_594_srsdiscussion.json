Humanities is almost entirely female dominated - as of right now, the gender split in college is nearing 60/40  - in favor of women. Account for the fact that men make up the majority of STEM students, you'll find they don't make their way into humanities very often. You just don't see men in gender studies because they don't feel it caters to them at all. Because there are no educational resources for it, no men are able to access it academically. It[.] cyclic. Imagine how threatening it would be to be the sole male in a classroom full of women in gender studies, and labelled as an oppressor. I don't blame men for avoiding it.\n\nMen are also encouraged away from humanities, by and large. We see them in STEM fields. But even now, the lack of men in secondary education is worrying to me. I think as it is right now, the education system does not favor men. I personally think you can even see it down at the elementary level. Boys are diagnosed with ADD - not because they actually are, but because they do not act like girls in the classroom. "}
