My boyfriend is a humanities guy and is intelligent as fuck. I am great at science. I feel like an idiot sometimes when we talk and rarely get to show off my knowledge because science doesn't come up as much in normal conversations. Also he probably would not understand half of the stuff I was saying if we talked about my interests.\n\nIt is really hard to talk about science on an intellectually stimulating level with people who have not studied it for years. Also non-science people tend to be bored by the things us science folk are interested in. It is easier to talk about humanities subjects because it is more accessible to normal folk. So have you ever thought maybe he thinks he is the smart one?\n\nTo answer your question, yes I have been with someone I did think was much less intelligent than me not just because he had different interests but because I was disgusted by some of the incredibly dumb things he would say and I felt like it was impossible to have any kind of intellectually stimulating conversation with him. I broke it off and found someone more on my level and am much happier for it."}
