I did a combined Commerce/Humanities program instead, with no real goal for after.\n\nSomehow I stumbled upon Linguistics when picking a major in university, and fell in love with it after my first semester. A few semesters later, I fell in love with my now fiance, also doing Linguistics with no life plan after graduation. That was a gamble because it[.] not a super employable degree.\n\nHe[.] self-taught in programming and IT stuff, so while we were students he worked in our faculty[.] IT department. After graduating, he ran with that track, and is now a technical consultant/sales engineer with a very major electronics company.\n\nI had no such skills, so just kind of went after whatever I could get.
