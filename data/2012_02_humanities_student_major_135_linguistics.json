It would be one thing if black people spoke a mutually unintelligible language. However, due to the fact that the two dialects are very similar and more or less use versions of the same verb for different yet similar syntactic constructions, and have a slightly different construction, the average person (i mean, like, everyone- politicians, school teachers, bankers, students) thinks that they are not two dialects, but instead \"good\" and \"bad\" versions of one language. Speakers of AAVE especially feel this way. So there is no code-switching culture that is as developed as in Africa or South_America or anywhere else, really.\n\nSo I agree, in theory we could expect the black population to learn both versions and know when to use which, which is common in places where the minority really *is* a small minority, and if the two dialects were more different. But as of now the socio-political climate doesn't create this situation. It[.] a problem of education and ignorance and happenstance.\n\nPlus, it is getting to the point where you *don't*necessarily need to speak standard english to be successful. For the average person, yes, this is a hindrance. But in the arts and entertainment, within companies or organizations founded by avve speakers, there isn't as much of a push to learn SE."}
