It[.] a ranked party school, and the average student drinks almost twice the national average of alcohol per week. It can get pretty wild. \n\nIowa State is more of an engineering school, most of the people that I know who go there are there for Engineering, Architecture, or Health sciences.\n\nIowa state has a much larger greek life than Iowa, however at Iowa, most of the students don't participate in greek life, whereas at Iowa State, more than half of the student body is Greek. \n\nIowa is a dry campus, Iowa state is not. \n\nI was kinda surprised when you said that there were so many students attending Iowa state, Iowa easily has more students from the chicago area than Iowa State. most of the student body of Iowa is Chicagoland area students and in state Iowans, whereas Iowa state is mostly in-state Iowans and students from minnesota, nebraska, and Missouri. \n\nIf you want to know anything more about either school, feel free to PM me. Obviously I know more about Iowa than Iowa State, but I might be able to help anyway. "}
