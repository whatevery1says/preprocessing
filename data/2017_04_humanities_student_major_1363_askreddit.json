We have complete opposite experiences. Literally EVERY. SINGLE. CLASS. I've had has found a way to incorporate religion/The Church.\nWe're in stats? Great! Let[.] analyze how many of you got engaged after less than a month. Physical Science? 25% of your test grade is dependent on you writing an essay about a General Conference talk. Finance? Let[.] talk about how getting married in the temple will save you thousands! Humanities? Let[.] talk about what Martin Luther did & how he[.] nothing like Joe Smitty because he just made that bullshit up - whereas ya boi Joseph had a \"revelation\". \n\nBYU is seriously the most closed minded, judgmental, hypocritical school I've ever been to. It is brain washing. Sure, the tuition is great, but did you know their Counseling & Psychological Services are booked out by MORE THAN 4 WEEKS?? Did you know that Provo was ranked the 2nd most stressed out city *in the nation?!*\n\nBYU is not liberal, last night my gay friend was upset because of some ignorant comment made by a group of girls living at the Village. When I opened up to my best friend and told her I was sexually abused & raped, she asked me, \"are you worthy to be at BYU?\" This is NOT open minded. This is NOT accepting. I'm glad you like BYU, but some of us are actually dredging through the muck of it all, trying to keep our head above water."}
