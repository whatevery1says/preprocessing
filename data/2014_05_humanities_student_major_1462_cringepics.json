Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, Dickinson, Twain, Whitman... useless \"elective\"  shit.  Oh and the study of what actually allowed you to sit in a classroom after years of clearly eating wrong and not exercising... totally pointless.  Academics who study the \"liberal_arts\" are useless... that[.] why authoritarian regimes always target them.\n\n... I'm going to take a break from the sarcasm.  I appreciate engineering and all those who study it; our country needs engineers, so thanks for filling that void.  But our lives need more than just that... we need art, poetry, literature, historical studies, great TV shows, amazing movies.  Building is great (and extremely necessary), but life is about so much more.  We're human and we have this damn self  awareness thing, we have to express it... in so many ways (including engineering!)   So, seriously, if you look down on someone for not being an engineering major.... look in the mirror, because you're most likely a self centered egotistical douche.\n\nedit: I'm not going to change the post, but I want to apologize for my personal attack on the person wearing this shirt. I'm no super model, I don't know what made me think I could score points by judging another person based on their appearance.  I'm very sorry for stooping so low.... but your shirt is still a fucking joke and you should be ashamed to wear it."}
