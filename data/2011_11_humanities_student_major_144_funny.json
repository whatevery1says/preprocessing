You are absolutely spot on. The other thing is that liberal_arts *can* attract the wrong type of people simply because of the fact that you really don't have to try hard to just *pass*. Speaking from my experience, though, to pull off a 4. 0 in your major and 3. 8 in your minor, you have to work your ass off. \n\nI wrote so many papers, man. So many. So many that two years later, I probably don't remember half of them. Obviously they were good (hopefully), but there were times where I was writing 4-5 papers at once. In the last month of my final semester, I wrote ~80 pages and had to prepare a creative writing portfolio that also had a 6 page paper within it. I was working part-time during all of this, but managed to finish everything but the final 10 pages of the paper for a graduate class I took for undergraduate credit. I was on the verge of a true mental breakdown when I finally called and pleaded with my professor. Thankfully, she was understanding enough to extend my paper until Monday, which was two days after I would be walking for graduation. I then had to deal with completely packing up and moving home, graduating, and finishing this paper. I did it. I got an A.\n\nSo thank you for giving us some respect. The truly good students in any discipline worked just as hard as you did."}
