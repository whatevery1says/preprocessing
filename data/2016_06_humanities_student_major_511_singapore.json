But I feel that it starts more from the education system - because the education system is predisposed and prizes the STEM subjects, parents have the impression that STEM subjects are the main criteria or markers for judging where their children do well or will have good prospects. \n\nIf we had an education system that is more balanced between the arts and sciences, parents might not feel so inclined to push their children towards choosing the sciences. I do think that there will *still* be parents who push or force their children to do sciences, but at least the children will have the option to push back and say hey, choosing arts doesn't mean I'm inferior to someone who chooses sciences.\n\nI also really wish that parents gave their children a bit more say over what they study. I was lucky because my parents let me decide even though they didn't quite agree with my going for arts subjects in JC and taking up a History major in uni. But I've also seen people who had to be retained in JC because they were forced to do sciences, and they did really well when they switched to arts. So I think a lot more can be done to educate parents about different paths in education - it[.] not about your child being *the best*, but about doing and choosing what[.] best for your child according to their needs and talents."}
