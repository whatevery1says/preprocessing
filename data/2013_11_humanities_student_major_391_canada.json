That[.] IF you're not a science/engineering/math/nursing/[*insert other specialized programs here*] student, and have the free credits/units. Note that the programs *most* suited to taking this stuff are in SocSci/Humanities, and the job market there is rough. It[.] just not reasonable to expect everyone to make the choices that provide an opportunity to take that course.\n\nIt[.] definitely a curriculum failure, but, man, think of all the shit we gotta teach inattentive kids. The solution, in my mind, is full-year education. Good luck with that, though."}
