They are a regionally accredited institution, but not specifically AACSB. Is this particular accreditation of vital importance for you?\n\nAnecdotally I will say that I have an undergrad degree with a 2. 7 GPA in liberal_arts. My professional experience is largely in non-profits and educational organizations and in project management. I had begun an MPA from U of Phx many years ago and did not complete my program. I opted to enroll in the WGU MS Management & Leadership program a few years ago and I had the most supportive and engaging mentor (advisor) through the program. I finished in just over a year and near the end of my program my mentor shared with me that I could reenroll for the MBA program and only have to take six additional courses because the MSML and MBA programs have overlap. Six months into my MBA program I was offered a huge promotion at my job and got a 60% salary increase. While I could have spent my time cultivating an MBA program at a State school\u2014the reality is that I have a family and need to work full time. My boss (I work in higher ed) fully supports WGU and knows their model works and works well for working adults and at a fraction of the cost. I have a friend who got an MBA from a prestigious state school locally and struggled to find a job after and is an immense amount of debt. I finished two degrees in 2. 5 years at a fraction of the cost. \n\nI don't think my MBA from WGU is viewed as inferior to say a program at a State school. \n\nI'm available for any questions specific to the program if you'd like to know more.
