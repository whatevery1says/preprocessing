In addition, you need to pick 1 major design project course (pick 1 from Mobile Apps, Software Engineering, Computer Architecture, Autonomous Robotics, Game Dev, and other special topic courses) along with the technical communication component with it (4-credits total).\n\nOther technical requirements include picking 1 between multivariable calc (calc 3) and differential equations (calc 4). You also need a class on linear algebra and statistics. You came in with both physics credits so that[.] great, but you still need a chemistry course + lab.\n\nYou'd also need to fill up certain other requirements (i. e. a 300-level LSA course and other humanities requirements).\n\nI'd recommend taking chemistry + lab at the local college, but definitely first check if you can transfer the credits in first.\n\nIn general, you can still graduate in 3 years if you don't test out of ENGR 101. Just make sure to take it in your first semester here. If you placed out of 101, then take EECS 203 and EECS 280 concurrently, because both of those are required for EECS 281, so make sure to get rid of those ASAP.\n\nEven if you don't do so, you can still take EECS 281 in the spring term (the \"summer\" term right after classes end on April). You have a lot of options open here, so don't stress too much!\n\nAnd as always, go blue!"}
