(Graduated in August instead of May). I was lucky, because my parents were paying for me 100%. \n\nI can't really think of anyone else who graduated on time. Partly because of bad planning. (Note: Ideally advisers would be worth a shit, but in reality, you have keep on top of what you need by using the net). \n\nNow, my other friends just failed out of school. None of them were real hardship cases, I think their parents paid for them and they didn't give a shit, so they failed out. I bet these are the real money makers for college. The kids who suck at school but have ATM[.] for parents. \n\nAs of right now I managed to get a 11 dollar an hour/23k a year job. I could have gotten it without a college degree, but I'm hoping my degree will come in handy further down the line should there be an arbitrary need for one. I'm also thinking of going back to school because my employer will pay. \n\nPersonally, I think I may have gone wrong in choosing a liberal_arts major. (Political science). Furthermore, For reasons (some my fault as well as not my fault) I didn't do all I should have to get the most worth out of my degree. For one, I should have taken an internship. Being both in a state capitol and being close to DC, I had a fair shake of opportunities. Also, I took a class with the mayor but didn't extend our relationship, nor get into the governors fellows program.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, if you are choosing to go to school, but not for something somewhat  useful (hard_science, computers, spanish) then be prepared to do work outside of class. \n\nAnd for the record, I don't regret going to school, as I had a blast and learned a lot about myself outside of class. That[.] usually a coy euphemism for \"partied!\" but I mean more than that. "}
