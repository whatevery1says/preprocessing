It[.] like these people don't listen to facts, and cling to their fact that while being statistically accurate, do not represent the claims that they base off of it. I put this on this post in a different comment but it seems it is needed again. In this post [Shady8x](http://www. reddit. com/r/MensRights/comments/11lsrw/feminist_myth_of_women_earning_072_to_a_mans_1/c6nmfiv%29It) gives over 30 sources showing how that statistic is accurate but doesn't necessarily mean there is a wage gap based on discrimination between genders.\n\nThe true difference is in the fact that 1. Men tend to work in the more dangerous workplaces that women avoid, and as such are paid more. 2. Women tend to work less hours than men (as a preference, not because they aren't able to get the same hours) which obviously means less money. 3. Women usually choose to be the main caretaker for children and as such leave their jobs or look for more flexible (lower paying) jobs. 4. Women tend to get degrees in liberal_arts and other related fields instead of the majors that are heavy in science and math.\n\nSo yeah there is a wage gap but it is purely due to preferences. Some women choose more flexible jobs or less hours which results in less pay. Others choose careers which have lower pay. But in the end if a woman gets the exact same degree as a man and looks for the same hours and whatnot, they can (and will) make as much money as a man."}
