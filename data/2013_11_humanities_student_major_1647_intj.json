What I am passionate about now, I do not think I would have been passionate about years ago. I don't think I have a true passion, I can't speak for others.\n\nYou may \"have\" to select a major, but consider it a formality and not a setting of stone of your future. At my school it was quite easy to switch majors, and most people who I knew in my first year changed majors by the time they graduated (if they graduated) - even the ones who seemed adamant about the subject.\n\nThe advice I would give you, but you don't seem to need, is to keep an open mind. I thought the disinterest/disrespect for liberal_arts in my scientific peers, and fear/disgust of science by many liberal_arts students was very depressing. We learn the most from what we want to know the least. :) You don't have to be a ____ major to learn about it - take a class if it suits you, check out books from the library about it - watch movies, talk to students in the field. You can only gain perspective from such things.\n\nA personal anecdote - I was a music major, and realized I was beginning to hate playing as it started to feel less like fun, and more like work. I decided I could continue playing, and pursue another field that I would find satisfying as \"work.\" In this case my passion wasn't necessarily my major (although I was passionate about both, in different ways).
