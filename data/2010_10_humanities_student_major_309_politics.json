If I'm paying that 15-25k a year in tuition, I'd like the freedom to pursue my education on my terms rather than be pigeonholed into a few classes because of requirements. Besides that, isn't being the entire point of grades K-12 to teach you the skills you need to be well rounded, hence making you take classes in almost every field? College should be when you really have the option to take classes that are meaningful to you rather than a continuation of K-12. If I had it my way, I would have taken as many life science courses as possible and possibly even a few computer science and engineering courses (because of requirements, I never had space on my schedule to do that so I always chose life science courses over that). \n\nEdit: At least in my University, there were just so many different classes that I really wanted to take, but because I had to reserve 3-6 credit hours every semester for a humanities class, I just couldn't take everything that I wanted learn about. In a way, I think it really limited my education and I feel almost cheated."}
