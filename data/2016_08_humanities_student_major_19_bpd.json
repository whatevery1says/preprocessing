To a certain extent, everybody is this way. That[.] why they say we are a mix of the five people we are closest to, and that we (everybody) should choose who they surround themselves with very carefully. \n\nI have noticed this tendency in a heightened way in myself, as well, though. So I try to be careful who I assign as my \"role model\" and then work hard at reminding myself that they are just a person and I am only seeing one side of them. It helps... it gives me confidence. \n\nAnyway... I went to uni for something because my crush at 15 was in school (older) studying it. It[.] stuck with me somehow, though, and I am 25 now. However, I do wonder where I'd be if I'd instead followed the path my natural talents laid out for me (maths and sciences rather than the liberal_arts, at which I've always had to try extra hard). \n\nI'd say the best way to decide is to take some courses and really dabble for a while. You can't decide by sitting back and thinking about it, you likely just don't have enough information. Use coursera and other moocs and don't be afraid to ask to shadow the people with the actual jobs you would get if you did those things. Sometimes the best thing to do is what you're good at naturally and if it[.] also what you can stand to do as a job, then I can't imagine much better. "}
