The school has a truly egalitarian mission and provides learning opportunities to those who otherwise would not have similar quality available to them. It is a real marathon to make it through, I would say. You get the opportunity to prove you can do Harvard quality work and thereby get invited to stay, but whether you actually succeed is a product of your own efforts.\n\nAcademic standards are high. There is no such thing as a easy Harvard degree.\n\nI think gdavtor is pretty spot on, except for the following statement, which bears clarification:\n\n\"More practically, HES doesn't grant typical four year college degrees like the College, it doesn't offer as many classes or much of an undergraduate experience.\"\n\nHES definitely has four year bachelor[.] degrees. What may make them seem atypical is that the people at HES have jobs and so it takes longer to complete. But that is more a product of the circumstances of the student rather than the program structure. But it can be done.\n\nOh - and there is this institutional quirk - the degree nomenclature is a little different . They call the bachelor[.] degree bachelor of liberal_arts rather than AB (the bachelor of arts degree awarded by the College.) The reason for this is historical and boring. Most agree the name should be changed but the basic requirements of the two programs are very similar.\n\nGdavtor is correct in that HES[.] course breadth isn't as wide, bit if you apply for special student status you can take courses elsewhere in the university (you may have to pay a special student fee though, which can be steep. I am, however, given to understand that that fee may be waived for good students.) There is more overlap being promoted lately, as technology has reduced the delivery costs.\n\nAs far as the undergraduate experience goes, I think it depends on how you define that. If you define it as living in undergraduate dorms and being cohorted, Gdavtor is correct. The conditions for a social experience ARE laid out for you quite nicely in the College, but at HES you have to construct it yourself. It is a product of your own efforts. But it is what you make it. Social people tend to build good networks with whatever resources they are given.\n\nWhy don't HES students get the same social platform (such as housing)? you might ask. Are HES students deemed second class citizens somehow? No. You have to look at the needs of the demographic. How many 30ish students are going to want to live in one of the Houses?? Not many.\n\nBut anyway -- HES offers a quality program that is very rigorous. The real distinction lies not between those who are admitted vs not, but those who have the stamina and motivation to complete it and those who don't.\n\nP. S. Having started my academic life at a community college years ago, I can tell you that comparing HES to a community college is sort of like comparing a Lamborghini Huracan to a Toyota Prius. HES[.] quality truly is hard to beat."}
