My BA in music required similar effort to my pending MS in computer science, they just required different types of effort.  For my BA, I had to practice 20+ hours per week for my instrument lessons and ensemble rehearsals.  I had to attend rehearsals for ~10 hours every week and I wasn't at a conservatory (conservatory students will spend more than 40 hours per week practicing and around 20 hours per week in rehearsals or lessons).  Then I had my class commitments.  Honestly, the class requirements for a music degree aren't all that hard.  Music history is mostly rote memorization and not very hard.  Music theory can be boiled down to about three pages of notebook paper, but it[.] actually pretty hard because you need to be able to read, write, hear, sing, and play the concepts.\n\nI spent more time studying concepts in computer science, but truly understanding the concepts for a music degree requires probably a 10:1 ratio of practice to study in order to really understand them.  In computer science it[.] relatively easy to apply the practice once you understand the concepts.\n\nI've lived in the worlds of STEM and liberal_arts.  If taught correctly, they're both very hard to master.  Liberal arts require a lot of practice but the theory is pretty easy to understand.  STEM fields require a lot of study to understand the theory, but once you understand the theory it[.] pretty easy to apply the theories in practice.  They're both tough in different ways."}
