Only one of them was able to test out of just the first semester, and he was home schooled, with  a strong concentration in music.\n\nOf course, that[.] going to depend on the school/program you'd go to. Even if you did test out of a semester of theory, though, I'm not sure if you'd want to - it does provide opportunities to meet and get to know your fellow music majors, and to learn the terms and ways that your school explains theory.\n\nI'm not trying to talk you out of learning Music Theory in high school - it[.] awesome to get an early start, and it[.] a good and valuable subject for its own sake, as well as for interpreting performance. But if you're killing yourself over it just in order to get a leg ahead for college, I'd say spend that valuable time staying sane. It[.] hard enough saying no to all the opportunities for stuff to do in HS, spend a little more time enjoying life.\n\nThat[.] just me."}
