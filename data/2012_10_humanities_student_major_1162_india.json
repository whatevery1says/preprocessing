Delhi? Mumbai? Bangalore? Pune?\n\nMumbai, Bangalore and Pune\n\n 2) In general, what is the student life like? What do students do for fun? Is there any way I can get an idea of what it[.] like to live there?\n\nYou will find the environment competitive at good school. For fun, students just hang out outside coffee shops. Trips to the cinema, eating etc.\n\n 3) How are the humanities taught in the \"good colleges?\" I've heard a lot of good things about places like St. Xavier[.], Nowrosjee Wadia, Fergusson and St. Stephen[.]. But that was largely from some magazines, like India Today. The people I've spoken to don't seem to think very highly of the formal education they received, firmly believing that what they learned outside of class was of more value than the rote-learning that they were forced into.\n\nIt is more a function of the professor than the college. If you get a good professor even the bad college would be good else a good college would also be bad. \n\n I just want a solid education. One that could prepare me well for a PhD program in the US/Europe. (preferably the US)\n\nYou should look at other countries as well. India is not a good launch pad for research programs.\n"}
