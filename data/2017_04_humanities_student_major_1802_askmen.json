Most students just put in the minimum effort to get a passing grade so I was impressed by how she always had a strong opinion and backed it up. I was even more of a goober back then so it took me considerable nerve to get to know her outside of class. I talked to her for about two weeks and she seemed cool and friendly. She seemed to have a bit of a strained relationship with her family.\n\nSpring break came and when I got back, she wasn't in the class anymore. The professor said she had to go back home.\n\nI don't remember if I even had a cell phone back then and this was before Facebook, so that was the last I ever saw or heard about her. I'm guessing something came up with her family or she just didn't like the school.\n\nIt[.] been probably 15 years now but every now and again I still wonder what happened to her and what she[.] up to. For a long time I was bummed out since it seemed like it could've been a really good relationship, but looking at it many years later I think I would have had very little conception about what to do with her and how to function in a relationship."}
