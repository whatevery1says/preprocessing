The author, though, is a bit off on this analysis, at least a bit biased. He is pretty much ignoring history.\n\nI grew up in the South and was in school in the 50s and 60s. For part of that time, I was in a Christian school. Even here in GA, evolution was freely taught in schools, both public and private. Even in our mandatory Bible class, evolution was accepted as valid and creation was considered an allegory.  The reversion to fanatics demanding that creationism be taught is a rather recent phenomenon.\n\nThe general negative attitude towards science long predates the creationism movement. In the 60s, there was great animosity towards science arising out protest to the Vietnam war as well as the \"intellectualism\" of the countercultural movement (\"Dow chemical makes Napalm, man\"). It was not pleasant being a Chem major at that time. Science was considered inferior to the \"more intellectual\" liberal_arts majors.\n\nAside from the timing, though, there is a fallacy. Though creationism runs in the face of Biology, it would have virtually no effect on or conflict with those interested in Chemistry, Physics, or Math. Those majors were considered less intellectual and, if the truth were to be told, more difficult.\n\nI do not support Creationism in any form, but, to me, this is a cheap shot from a journal that should be above such efforts. \n\n"}
