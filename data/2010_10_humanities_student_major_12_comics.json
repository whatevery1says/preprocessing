In my view he is more than 'the man'. He is god. And in my opinion the plot line is Moore[.] retelling of humanities story with God and his vision of place of God today and tomorrow. \n\n\nGod is born in a \"prosaic\" (accidental) matter out of something we can explain. He starts out as a simple tribal God, he performs miracles for his American tribe and tries to improve the lot of his people (his actions during the cold war). Gradually he grows beyond the role of the tribal God and becomes the conquering God of the old testament (a moment exemplified when the Vietnamese surrender to him). As he continues to grow he becomes the God of love working on a machines to spread infinite 'love'  to his people. I think the moment that you are talking about is the point when humanity proclaims 'God is dead, fuck God' (thank you Mr. Nietzsche). So God leaves to understand what value he can be to creatures that don't want him. Ultimately he chooses to allow Azimandeous' plan as the result is that afterward humanity truly no longer needs a God and that is the only way forward in the relationship. I think the story also suggests that great evil occurs because sometimes humans cannot make progress through good. \n\n\nThat[.] my take, but I am far from an lit major so maybe I am not reading this right.
