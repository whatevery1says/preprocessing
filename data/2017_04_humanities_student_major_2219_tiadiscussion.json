But over the last few years I've come to think I was wrong.   \n\nThe really outlandish examples of outright totalitarian insanity are rarer, of course. I've become just as concerned about the low-key, pervasive leftist bias. There aren't many huge lefty blow-ups here... but that[.] in part because people tend to self-censor.  \n\nI do a small unit on this craziness in one of my courses--working hard to be objective about it... but it[.] difficult, of course. We discuss a few common claims--e. g. that race and \"gender\" are socially constructed and so on--and the PC/SJ phenomenon and its links to philosophical views that took over many of the humanities and social_sciences. At first students are kind of afraid to talk, but when they see that I'm not One Of Those Professors, some of them open up.  I do tell them which side I sympathize with, and that I might not be entirely objective... but that may very well keep students on the other side from speaking up.\n\nStudents have told me that they have some profs who are very biased to the_left, but those are the minority--though one student just said to me that one of his profs teaches the PC/SJ stuff as if it were just fact. The most common recent responses I've gotten basically go like this:  in class, you don't know the other people, and so you don't want to offend anyone. And there are some people who flip out if you deviate from accepted views. So it[.] both polite and prudent to keep your thoughts to yourself.   \n\nThere[.] really a complex of dimensions to this problem: occasional crazies and extremist freak-outs, widespread, low-grade self-censorship, and the growth of the consumer/business model of education and a bloated administration that, like the faculty, has a generally liberal/left bias... but many administrators are basically bureaucrats, not scholars. So they don't really understand nor have a commitment to the genuine intellectual ends of the university. And they want to keep the students happy and the money rolling in.\n\nI've experienced less overt, spittle-flecked insanity  and more of a passive fear of / aversion to the kind of rough-and-tumble of genuine, unfettered exploration of ideas one associates with college.  \n\nBut it depends a lot on your acquaintances and major. Some but not all of the humanities and social_sciences seem to be just lousy with the stuff... but my own department in the humanities is pretty damn sane, even the people with leftist sympathies. We've got one or two kind of lefty profs... but those people are mostly airheads rather than rabid nutballs. OTOH, one of my colleagues initiated sexual harassment charges against another a few years back over a completely harmless humorous comment that the second prof had made (to me, actually), *sotto voce*, in the department. So that was insane..."}
