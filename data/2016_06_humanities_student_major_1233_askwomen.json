All of the advanced level electives were STEM. They actually had five different engineering options. My options were essentially take something I have no interest in at a high level or take something I'm interested in but kill my gpa because the course isn't weighted as much. \nSTEM is important and should be offered in schools, don't get me wrong, but there are so many careers outside of the STEM field. If we pigeonhole everyone into STEM, eventually things are going to be messed up. \n\nMy sociology degree is currently doing me pretty well. I'm in a top ten MSW program and almost guaranteed a job out of school because the field is becoming more and more in demand. I'm proud of my sociology degree even though many (ignorant) people told me I would accomplish nothing and didn't think I was smart.\n\nThe idea that if you don't major in business or STEM you won't get a job is ridiculous. Just because there isn't one corresponding job with a liberal_arts degree doesn't mean that there aren't jobs. The world can't run off of just business and STEM and kill off all other sectors. If people go into fields that they aren't passionate about just because they think that it will get them a job, the world is going to become really unhappy. "}
