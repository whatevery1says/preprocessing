This leads to thtem being BTFOed easily in any kind of political debates. One reason for this could be that most LW are humanities guys and RWs tend to stay away from humanities.\n\n**Since this is the Top post in this thread: Every *serious* right_winger willing to argue with leftists must read the following books.**\n\n* The Dialogues and Republic by Plato\n\n* The Quran(so you can cite the violent passages and shut liberandus up). Oxford Classics edition is fine, but [this Norton is the best](https://www. amazon. com/Quran-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393927059/).\n\n* The Science of Logic by GWF Hegel\n\n* A basic book on political theory. Once you've familiarised your self with basic ideas, read [these books](https://i. imgur. com/dDDStyp. jpg)\n\nThe list above has the following books missing, but they are equally important.\n\n* Grundrisse by Karl Marx\n\n* Discourses on the Livy by Machiavelli\n\nAnd I know it says not to skip any book, but you can skip St Augustine, mainly because later thinkers are more important, and that it is massive book(1200 pages)\n\nAlso, familiarise yourself with the basics of Christianity, then read [Kierkegaard](https://www. amazon. com/Trembling-Penguin-Classics-Soren-Kierkegaard/dp/0140444491/) and Nietsche to critique Christianity.\n\n* For Hindutva thought, read Ram Swarup, [Sita Ram Goel](https://www. amazon. in/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/258-4887813-3885400?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=sita+ram+goel) and Vivekanand.\n\n* For History, read Jadunath Sarkar\n\nFollow Swarajya and read everything they write. Even better, subscribe to them.\n\nAlso never believe something you read on the internet unless you've verified from atleast 2 separate reputable sources."}
