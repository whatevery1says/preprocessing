Maybe in software development that works but try any engineering field and that does not apply. \n\nI've heard tons of comments on the job in my own experience of how \"worthless\" liberals arts is and we should just make more room for the STEM people. \n\n\nYou're right there are some history and english majors that happen to get into a dev role, but that is not the norm even remotely with the abundance of CS majors now, especially if the job is making regular use of rigorous computer science concepts.\n\n\nEven at my job there is tons of liberal_arts majors that got into a role, but that was 30 or 40 some years ago. They're boomers that \"just happened to\" get into their job. It[.] like they didn't even have to try to get it. Nowadays it[.] a whole different game. \n\n\n\nI am more talking about the implicit bias against liberal_arts in most STEM fields now, both inside and outside academia. It[.] pretty hard to ignore where I am--it[.] very prevalent. People are always focused on money, not personal wellbeing and happiness. It'd ridiculous.\n\n\nMention english as a reasonable career choice/major, and you can hear the scoffs, snivels, hems and haws from over a mile away. The superiority complex among engineers in this scenario is fucking palpable."}
