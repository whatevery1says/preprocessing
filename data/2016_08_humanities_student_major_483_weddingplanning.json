We're paying $500 for our photographer and it included our engagement shoot. The photography was not a major priority for me at all and I personally have no interest in taking all the posed action shots and the artsy set up shots (me getting ready, everyone fixing my dress, my dress/shoes and ring, etc). I want the family photos, photos of the ceremony and of the reception but much more photojournalistic in style. Our photographer is a recent graduate and she has experience in doing fashion photography and other types, but not weddings. We really liked the idea of giving someone a chance because we're both creative/artistic and understand where she[.] coming from. Our engagement photos came out great and I don't have any doubt she'll do a great job with our wedding. I'm sure I'll end up with her doing some of the more typical wedding poses so she can build up her own portfolio but I'm really not that big on photos. I honestly cannot fathom spending thousands of dollars on a photographer but that[.] my own personal opinion. I know there[.] the saying \"you get what you pay for\" but we both like her work and like her style/personality so there[.] no worry. \n\nEdit: we're getting 2 photographers, all our photos and unlimited time for that price.
