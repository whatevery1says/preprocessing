It[.] a complex and rich field just like biology, just like neuroscience. I say that as someone who in fact does have a neuroscience degree. Stop judging/looking down at other fields just because they might lean toward the liberal_arts instead of being hardcore STEM. There are merits to both. \n\nAlso, when you get to a graduate level, especially for PhD, it[.] pretty safe to correlate how hard it is to get in with how hard the degree is. PhD cohorts are pretty small, it[.] not like getting into undergrad at all. Getting into a GOOD PhD means you'll undergo a lot of scrutiny, interviews, and even then you basically have to convince a bunch of people on a personal level that you know your shit well enough that you deserve to get money just so you can use your knowledge and skills to literally drive the field forward. A PhD is a grueling process and a high bar for entrance means an institution is going to expect a LOT out of you. They want a return on their investment."}
