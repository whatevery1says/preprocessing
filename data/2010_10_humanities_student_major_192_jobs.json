With a bachelor[.], you will have taken maybe 10-12 upper-division courses in your major. They aren't even graduate level. You're not an expert in sociology or any other one field.\n\nHopefully, what you can do is see plans through and write decently. That[.] what most BA/BS degree (but especially liberal_arts ones) show.\n\nIf you want to get into non/not-for-profit, it would help a lot to have management and/or accounting coursework or experience. The fact that you have any BA/BS degree is good; what they will want to see in addition are applicable skills like accounting, finance or non-profit management courses.\n\nSo I'll ask this of you like I ask of others: **other than dreaming and talking about a job in your 'dream' field, what have you actually done that those employers value in applicants?** You can do related course work or have paid/volunteer experience in that or a closely-related field. Because talk[.] cheap; what makes employers hire are one or both of those things.\n\nEspecially when it comes to non/not-for-profit experience, you can more easily get at least volunteer experience in many of those fields because they lawfully can use volunteer labor and its use is often a big part of their operations."}
