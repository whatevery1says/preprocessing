I thought it was like the educated mature college students on the college[.] commercials. \n\nThere were hipsters, the \"I'm the most unique person in the world\" kind of person, computer nerds, stoners, and strange artsy people who share Lady Gaga[.] makeup advice. Plus GOD FORBID you believe in Jesus Christ, there are only atheists and hipsters who adopted Buddhism. You are an outcast if you wear a little gold cross around your neck. Also if you want to fit in, you have to be anti-American to the point where you want to burn flags while pissing on the flames. Everyone swamped the city when the whole \"Occupy Wallstreet\" was going on. For some reason everyone is \"against the system\" which I don't even understand what that means. My classmates acted like their high school was some sort of hell hole and that kids in sports were the devil. It was offensive because I was the track team captain in high school, and when I told them they called me a \"system supporter.\"\n\n**Edit:** Also I'm finally graduating college next Sunday! I stayed at the college but switched to Liberal Arts, so I migrated off their art campus into their *real* main campus. HERE I found the college kids I was expecting to find."}
