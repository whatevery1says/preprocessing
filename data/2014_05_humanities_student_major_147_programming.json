If you have the aptitude for it, you can definitely learn enough on your own in a couple of years to be a useful addition to a development team.  In fact, given that the majority of programrs are actually pretty bad, you're likely to be more valuable than the majority of graduates at that point.\n\nBut you didn't learn everything that a four-year degree can give you.  That takes years more work.  Not only do you need the standard continue-to-learn mindset that all devs need, but if you really want to grow, you also have to go back and learn all that CS stuff that you skipped.  And that[.] *really* hard, because it doesn't seem relevant.  It[.] so much simpler to learn a new framework or a new db or something that will get your next product to launch.  But algorithms, parsing, math, all that stuff gives you a grounding for deeper concepts that you can't get anywhere else.    And because you're working during the day, it[.] going to take you more than four years to get there.  \n\nOTOH, I think the idea of humanities et. al. in college forming a \"well-rounded person\" is pretty much BS.  Maybe that was true decades ago, but most recent CS grads I meet are stunningly ignorant of the humanities.  It[.] really sad, IMHO.  \n"}
