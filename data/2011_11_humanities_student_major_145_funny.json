I TA/grade electrical engineering courses and in general, the undergrad engineers are pretty cocky with an \"I know everything\" kind of attitude even though the majority don't know jack squat about electromagnetism, signal analysis, microchip fabrication or any advanced, real-world topics. They know enough to build a circuit and use an arduino and like to lord it over non-engineers, but in reality they're fairly clueless.\n\nMy theory is this: as an undergrad, you learn a lot, so much so that you think you know everything. And that makes you cocky and think you can fix the economy because \"it[.] really easy, but economists are idiots, here[.] how you do it...\" (yes, that[.] a real quote I overheard last week). The reason graduate degrees are more highly valued is because in graduate school you learn how little you really know. You actually know MORE than undergrads, but you have a much greater grasp of how little that actually amounts to. So you have more knowledge, but are far more humble about it.\n\nI have a BS in physics and am a 3rd year Phd student in EE--I don't know jack shit.\n\ntl;dr: Non-technical degree people--I am sorry that the job market isn't terribly friendly towards humanities degrees, but engineering undergrads are remarkably cocky, so don't take it personally."}
