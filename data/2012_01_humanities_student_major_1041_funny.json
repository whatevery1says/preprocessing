Start preparing now if you haven't already.\n\nI graduated with two degrees most people would find worthless, one in Political Science and the other in History. When I was a student, I took a job in my campus IT department. I'm now working as a network technician at an IT firm and slowly working on my graduate degree. The endgame plan is for me to get a job as a professor or with the government. Historians need to learn a lot of languages if they're doing their degree right. I'll be able to take a position working in or dealing with Turkey, any Arabic-speaking country, or Iran once I finish my language study in the next 3 years. I could probably work in/with Germany right now after my undergraduate studies, though it'd necessitate a bit of a re-acquainting time period.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your degree is (a lot of the engineers I went to college with are still unemployed or working part-time a few years on.) What matters is what you do to set yourself up when you get out. It might be harder for someone with a liberal_arts degree to make companies want to hire them, but it[.] certainly not impossible if you don't just spend every night in college dicking around doing nothing."}
