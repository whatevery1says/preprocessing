In college I just could not stand this really popular guy. I knew him from a program we did together and people were always impressed that we knew each other. I was a burn-out underachiever, liberal_arts geek. He was a handsome jock, frat boy, from money, super charming and pre-med. He was universally loved but gave me the heebie jeebies. The last interaction we had, he asked if he could eat lunch with me and we talked for a while and I just felt like he was faking his entire existence, and that he was just using me for something, I guess. It left me feeling very bizarre. One of my girlfriends made a joke about him wanting to date me and that I would one of the \"in crowd\" now and I just told her hell no, he calls us friends but we both know it[.] a lie. She made jokes about setting us up and I said something like, \"I would kill you if you ever left me alone with that creep.\"\n\nAnyway, a few weeks later he was arrested for kidnapping and raping another student for something like 18 hours. It was sickening. He was a total sociopath and I fully believe that girl is lucky to be alive. I think he would have killed her and tried to hide her body if somebody hadn't discovered her first. Of course that[.] total speculation but my gut says he would have done it."}
