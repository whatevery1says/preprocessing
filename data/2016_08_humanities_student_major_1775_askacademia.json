Approach some professors who teach and offer to give a lecture; just talk about topics you like and would like to cover. Many people like to have 1-2 invited lectures towards the end of their courses.\n\nLook at summer programs in colleges around. Look at continuing education and courses for adults. Many colleges have programs like that; you can propose a nice and pleasant course, submit it, and if they like it, they'll let you teach it. Brown University has a huge summer program, but I'm sure many places at Boston have them as well.\n\nThe next step would be to look whether liberal_arts colleges around invite postdocs to teach either very short intense courses, or small seminars. Colleges like it because its cheap, and it[.] very useful for your CV if you want to become a professor. Also teaching upper seminars may be easier for a postdoc, as you can teach something that you do, or at least very close to your area.\n\nYou should not overdo teaching, as research matters more, but if by the end of your postdoc you have 1-2 interesting gigs, it will make you a much better candidate later on."}
