Lots of people make fun of the career options available to humanities_major, but all of the ones that I know are working regularly and making a decent salary.  I would probably chose communications and I would be sure to stay in school until I had achieved a terminal degree in the subject so that I could teach as well as work in the field.  \n\nI wouldn't focus as much on my career as I have in the past.  I would take more days off, travel more, ride my bike as much as possible and have a lot more fun.  I would buy the house that I really wanted, instead of settleing for what was available.  I would say please and thank you a lot more that I have up until now and I would stop myself from being the judgemental prick that I sometimes found myself being when I was younger and more full of myself.  \n\nI'm 37 years old and one of the most important lessons that I've learned since graduating from college is that I have no answers to this life so its sensless to try to impose anything that I believe onto anyone else.  \n\nI would still marry the same girl that I did in my current life and we'd still have our same, wonderful family but just about everything else would be different.
