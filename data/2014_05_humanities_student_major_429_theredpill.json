It[.] the perfect fucking storm. I'm a semi-member of pike at a school back home that I don't go to, so I know exactly how great they are (speaking of rape frats). \n\n\nHere[.] exactly how fucked up my school is- About half of the guys here are normal ass dudes. They play sports, drink and smoke, have legitimate majors, and are just trying to go out and bag bitches on the weekend. The problem is, there[.] only about 100-200 girls in the whole school who drink at a normal college level. That[.] a liberal estimate. The hot ones all go to the bars and get hit on by seniors (never fuck them though), the medium ones go to parties and MAYBE put out once in a blue moon, and the ugly ones (and boy do I mean ugly) chase jerseys like its their job. What you're left with is 500 athletic dudes competing over 50-75 not that cute girls who are all having the time of their life; standing in the corner at parties drinking free alcohol, waiting to get hit on by hundreds of men that wouldn't have talked to them in highschool. I got laid way more and by hotter chicks in highschool.\n\n\nI'm considering making a post about why not to go to a liberal_arts college. The only thing that[.] good about it is the networking connections and the promises of great jobs once I graduate. But these promises are being made by the same people who said college would be awesome, so I can't really trust them."}
