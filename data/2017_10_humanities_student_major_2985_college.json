It[.] silly to go into debt to avoid your parents to this extent... are there any ways you can gain a bit of freedom? Have you talked with them about it? Asked about their concerns? Offered anything to assuage their apparent fears that you'll go on a coke-fueled murder spree or something?\n\nDo you have friends you could crash with a few nights a week? Or even rent a bedroom (or PART of one) from someone? Then tell the folks you are stuck on campus working on a group project late, can't waste time driving home, etc. Maybe they'd get used to it if you ease them into it over time.\n\nThis is a crappy situation to be in, frankly. As a professor I always urge students to live on campus or at least independently of their parents if at all possible. You are an adult, old enough to be drafted and go to war, old enough to sign a contract, old enough to be a parent, old enough to make your own decisions. If they aren't actually contributing to your financial needs (for college, obviously they are providing room and board) maybe it[.] time to walk away. Unless there[.] some backstory here we're not getting-- good grades? no criminal record? You should be treated like an adult, not a child."}
