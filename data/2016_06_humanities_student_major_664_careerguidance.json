The job market is tough for those of us without vocational skills (teaching, accounting, etc.). I have a Masters and years of excellent experience in the field of my choosing but I still struggle to get interviews for jobs I am perfectly qualified for. \n\nThat being said my advice for you is to focus on the transferable skills you gained in college. Were you president of a student org? Then you have leadership and management experience. Did you conduct research? Did you do large presentations? Then you have public speaking skills. Liberal arts degrees were never meant to lead directly to jobs. They were meant to make you a well rounded and competent person who could do any number of things. \n\nOne other thing I've learned is that it almost never is about you specifically; it[.] almost always about the other candidates. It has less to do with whether or not you are qualified and more to do with how those qualifications stack up against the people applying for the same job which, depending on any number of factors, could mean you end up at the bottom or the top of the pile. And ultimately, no degree will get you a job. It might help get an interview but only you can tell/demonstrate why you are the best candidate. \n\nJust hang in there. You don't need to get every job. All you need is one offer."}
