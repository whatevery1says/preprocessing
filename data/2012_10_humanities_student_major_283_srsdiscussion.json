It isn't just a matter of the recession or the current job market - securing jobs in academia (and particularly in humanities) has been getting more and more difficult for a long time. And keep in mind that \"who knows\" also means \"who knows if it'll get much worse.\"\n\nJust to clarify, I'm not saying YOU CAN'T DO IT!! because I'm sure you would be a great professor - and I'm not even saying YOU WON'T GET A CHANCE because maybe you will - I'm just saying it would be wise to have a backup option and to consider lots of career/field choices before you set your mind on doing the most difficult thing you can do with a humanities degree. That is: get a degree in a humanities field because it[.] what you want to learn about, not because you think it'll open the door to professorships - and make sure there are other options for you, either with that degree or with additional majors and minors."}
