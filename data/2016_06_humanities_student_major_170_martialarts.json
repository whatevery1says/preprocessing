Why is aikido traditional but judo not when judo is older? Why is wing chun traditional but boxing not when boxing is just as old or older? \"Traditional\" is a stupid term for stupid people. Don't be stupid.\n\n Its not 'pure' jkd, but rather the head instructors interpretation with the arts he learnt. Look at the link in my other post. He seems to be well respected and teaching for a long time.\n\nWho cares if he[.] respected? Either he teach you how to fight or he can't. If he can teach you how to fight, then I imagine some of his students compete--and win--in full-contact competitions. If so fine, he[.] great. Otherwise don't waste your time.\n\n That[.] good to know, as I would assume ppl to just tell me to learn muay Thai or kickboxing.\n\nI'm not sure they'd be wrong. Muay thai is great and widely available. If this savate you are considering learning is taught by a coach who has never produced savate competitors, it[.] probably crap.\n\n Even if I found the school from the official website? \n\nDon't be a rube. Systema is pretty much all snake oil.\n\n Good point. So what if I do TKD instead of Savage, and just say its [.]port' like tennis?\n\nI'm not sure what the heck tennis has to do with this, but I'd take Savage over anything else.\n\n\n"}
