In fact due to this many departments are starting to phase out the GRE (or at least the subject tests) as an admission requirement/barrier. The gist of everything is, standardized testing is a very poor predictor for graduate school success. As for your other example, grades, undergraduate grades are actually also a very poor predictor of graduate school success (I will link references when I get the chance). Many departments are now emphasizing scores/grades a lot less and research experience and recommendation letters more in admissions as a result. Disclaimer: my background is STEM (physics and engineering specifically) so most of my statements are in that context; it might be different for the humanities and feel free to correct me if that[.] the case. \n\nLastly I just want to point out that your comment that \"the higher your social class is, the better your ability\" is plainly false. If you truly believe that being born into a wealthy family makes people smarter than I don't know what else to tell /you/, I truly hope I'm misunderstanding your statement or you're trolling "}
