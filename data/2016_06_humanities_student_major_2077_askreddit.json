You, individually, may not have profited from anything that the politicians elected by boomers and the current boomer politicians have done. Ditto for millions of others. But many from your generation did, and many of them now expect their Social Security, their Medicare, and shovel verbal manure on younger generations who are getting the short end of the stick, calling them lazy, entitled good-for-nothings with their wild expectations of being able to provide for themselves with just one full time job.\n\nYoung people have been making their voices heard for years now, asking for policies that will make their educations cheaper, easier, and for opportunities to get on the corporate ladder rather than \"entry level jobs\" requiring 5 years of experience to even apply. The resounding response so far has been \"Fuck you kids, you don't deserve shit. Probably majored in feminist fisting theory and that[.] why you can't get a real job\" to a generation in which just 3% of people went to liberal_arts school and majored in the \"artsy fartsy\" humanities.\n\nYou're right, a lot of boomers didn't go out and push the \"screw the middle class and young people\" button. But enough either stood by or eagerly voted those who did in power and now they can't accept that this is what they've done, and to prevent admitting their mistakes, they blame the younger generations for being lazy."}
