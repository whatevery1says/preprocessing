I'll give you a hint, nobody gives a fuck about the fact that they smoke weed, it[.] because they write sentences like \"weed promotes critical independent thinking\".\n\nI'm just as in favor or legalization as you are (of all drugs, tbh), but don't pretend weed or shrooms or LSD or cocaine or whatever \"enlightens\" you or some shit. It[.] a drug, you take it because it makes you feel good. It makes you stupid and happy for a few hours, and then you come back to reality. It[.] not some magical life enhancing elixir, it[.] a fucking psychoactive substance. And while you should be able to put whatever substance you want into your body without fear of the moral police government coming to lock you up for it, don't pretend the government uses it to keep enlightened liberal_arts majors from smoking so much weed they figure out the way that the lizard people in congress are ruling the world.\n\nSure the government imposes harsher penalties on crack so they can lock up poor people, but you don't see anyone smoking crack then talking about how they figured it all out.\n\nhttps://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Drug_prohibition#US_prohibition_of_opium\n- history of prohibition in the united states"}
