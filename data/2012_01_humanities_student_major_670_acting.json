I have a double major in Theater Performance and Philosophy (not for the back up job, obviously) but I found ways to make it work so that I didn't end up taking too many extra classes. It probably depends on if the acting program is actually a conservatory at your school, if you're in a BFA program (they often have strict rules about what you can and can't do while you're in the program), and how much leeway your school/departments will be in letting your core curriculum overlap with one of your majors (assuming that this is a liberal_arts college with a core curriculum). For example, can an intro to journalism class count as a lower level English-related class? If I were you I would go see an adviser or a favorite professor (in either major) and discuss your options, that way you'll at least know what changing or adding a major would mean before you make the decision.\n\nBest of luck to you in your decision making!\n\nedit: I just re-read your statement and I see that you've already switched majors... anyway most of what I said is still valid, see if double majoring will work for you (I know a handful of people who have done that at my school and it seems to be working out for them just fine)."}
