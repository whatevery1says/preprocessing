I think our technological advancement has outpaced our ethical advancement, and the gap is only widening. Ethics, not just economics, should come into play when setting goals for what new technology we want, but that conversation rarely takes place. So instead of figuring out how to better distribute the food we have to feed more people around the world, the research is on how to reduce costs and increase profitability. Ethics is out of the loop.\n\nAlso, as new technologies arrive faster and faster, many of them challenge core values of privacy and individual rights - but our systems for responsibly integrating the tech into society are way too cumbersome.\n\nI guess it falls mainly to the justice system to look for abuses of the technology that in some way violate an existing law, or the legislature to integrate ethical considerations into a new law. But, at least in America, both these methods are very slow, subject to manipulation, and don't always speak for the poor or disenfranchised.\n\nIt seems to me that small groups of concerned people like the Electronic Frontier Foundation are really the ones that are hammering out the ethics of the 21st century, but not every interest group has a powerful advocate like that. I think systemic changes would be better.\n\nSo yes, I think philosophy, history, etc, are needed more and more and valued less and less. I did science in school so I'm not even a humanities major, but I'm still saddened by how little respect they get considering that technology alone is not going to solve our social problems.\n\n"}
