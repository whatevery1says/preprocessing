Really not that easy.\n\nDeciding the cut off for who gets the bursary to support their health insurance plan? Not easy.\n\nLooking through special case applications for late opt outs and increased coverage on a specific event? Also really not easy.\n\nStudent Services: Have you heard of Safe Walk? AMS Tutoring? Sexual Assault Centre? I can assure you people use these services\n\nClubs: That was a very simplistic view. Imagine having to support over 400 student groups of varying size, providing them with group insurance rate for events, support with contracts, short term loans for those clubs, securing and managing club assets, making sure their financials are in order, managing any legal issues that arise from clubs, administering a lot of money in form of grants to innovative projects, managing specific student fees that come in (the Arts and Culture fee, Resource Group fee) and the opt-out process. Tell your 7 year old niece good luck for me.\n\nProvincial lobbying: Actually, the provincial government has listened to our feedback on many recent bills (such as the new Societies Act, the Sexual Assault Support Bill) and the municipal government has been working closely (and productively) with the AMS on transit issues.\n\nEmployment opportunities: lol."}
