I finished my undergrad at a highly ranked liberal_arts college, but I wasn't very focused on pure math grad school, so I didn't have many impressive classes, hence where I eventually ended up after deciding to give grad school a shot.  I'm doing fine in my program, and I am enjoying aspects of it, but I'm fairly sure I do not want to enter academia later.  This is especially considering the uphill battle I face coming from a not-top-tier school.  I have done a little programming, but not as a real job or anything, and I did enjoy it.  Given that I am studying graph theory and combinatorics (and a little bit of linear programming/optimization etc), how can I hope to steer my career somewhere where I might get to think about those ideas a little bit?  I do not think I want to aim for a run of the mill software job.  Thus my questions are:\n\n1.  What courses or skills should I pursue, while completing my program, to be a competitive job applicant for industry positions?\n\n2.  How do I avoid finding myself being only qualified for entry-level-ish positions rather than research-type positions?\n\n3.  In terms of career outlook, is it worth attempting to finish the PhD rather than mastering out if I am not trying to go to academia?\n\nThanks, I'd really appreciate hearing people[.] thoughts on this."}
