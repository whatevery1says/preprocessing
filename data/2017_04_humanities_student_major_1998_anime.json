It[.] so hard to retain viewership when you're talking about stuff like rakugo, farming, and WHACKING CARDS. \n\nI feel like I get more out of a series when I've gained external knowledge about a topic I wouldn't dream to dwell in if it wasn't shoved into this form of entertainment. \n\nAt the end of the day, it[.] a values game for me when I review a show. How much of it did I enjoy? What did I get out of this show? Is it a show that will resonate with me in someway? \n\nThanks to these shows, I have a newfound appreciation for the arts presented in these shows. I'm intrigued in regards to the mechanical differences in storytelling in Rakugo, the whole positioning of cards in Chihayafuru is one skill that can be further used in other tabletop games, and Silver Spoon shows us the consequences of making bonds with livestock.\n\nIf you're having fun learning, you've already done something a vast majority of educators  cannot do. That[.] why so many science teachers look to Bill Nye to teach a concept or two in class. A good educator cannot be taken for granted, and a form of entertainment that you willingly go into to watch and learn is one I place a lot of appreciation for."}
