Perhaps having the \"paid co-ops\" go directly to their tuition instead. Otherwise you're only mandating a student pay for the privilege of working for a company.\n\nQuite frankly, it[.] the businesses fault in the first place that they're not getting the_right kinds of workers. They've decided unilaterally that they will no longer provide on-the-job training. They expect and demand that any worker that comes to them be fully trained, usually via some college program.\n\nWhy must a university student take a 2-year course in HR or office administration to get hired? Is it really so difficult to train them on the job, as they go about? You're already getting somebody trained for critical thinking (theoretically). Shouldn't that be enough, that they've learnt how to teach themselves? That[.] supposedly the goal and major benefit to humanities degrees in the first place. That *used* to be how it worked.\n\nI see a lot of these businesses complain in the past about how the people they're getting out of college don't know how to write or critically think. Well they're not being trained to do that in a 2-year program. That was the whole bloody point of university in the first place. If businesses are looking for certain skills then they need to start *training* in certain skills. "}
