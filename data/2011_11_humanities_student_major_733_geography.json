While a professor isn't something you go for if you're looking for a lucrative career... they certainly make enough. \n\n$80k w/ a four year degree isn't happening unless you major in CS and get hired by a software development firm or plan on a lot of research in geophysics. It[.] certainly not happening in the humanities/social science aspects of geography.\n\nI'm currently doing a PhD in geography (GIScience and cartography) and it[.] been a great experience. Life as a grad student won't have you swimming in money but the opportunities are second to none. Grad school should never cost you a dime - if a program doesn't fully fund you, don't go. A master[.] and PhD are/should be financially free - you'll actually make money while doing it. If you have the chance (and many do without realizing it), it[.] hard to pass up.\n\nIf you like travel, research can scratch that itch. So far, I've had all-expenses paid trips to various cities in the US and internationally (I spent a week last July presenting work in Paris - the only things I had to pay for were a few gifts I brought back for family). My roommate during my master[.] program spent his summers in Kenya, getting paid for every minute of it. Another friend spent 4 months in Turkey, same deal.\n\nAcademia isn't for everyone and it[.] a long road... but if you love geography and a break from the 9-5 thing with plenty of travel, it[.] worth considering."}
