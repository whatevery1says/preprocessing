The prestige of the university does not directly correlate with the quality of the instruction. Really, the highest concentration of good teachers was at the small liberal_arts school, but there are excellent and horrible teachers at every level of education.\n\nThe main difference I saw was in the type of students. At every institution, there were 3 main types of students: the superstars, the workers, and the warm bodies. Really good schools have a higher percentage of superstars which allows professors to use more intensive (and interesting) approaches, but the best schools also have a stronger sense of entitlement in the warm bodies section. Community colleges are mostly workers and warm bodies, but I met superstars who were just as amazing as those at the highest level schools.\n\nYou're asking about perception, which is a different matter than what I've described above. Most schools would recognize that there[.] a range of great prospective students from different prestige levels of the schools, but there[.] always the lazy or prejudiced individual who will base their judgement on the name of the school."}
