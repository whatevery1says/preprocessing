His centerpiece $48bn company tax cut, unveiled in a pre-election budget, was modelled as delivering a 0. 6% boost to gross national income in a decade, but there are not convincing answers to questions about how much of the tax relief would flow offshore or the extent to which growth would fill the budget hole left by the revenue forgone. (...) His agenda has been weighed down by the often regressive \"zombie\" spending cuts, still lingering in the budget from 2014 but never legislated, cuts to government payments to the poorest Australian families and a four-week wait before young people could receive the dole. His climate policy and marriage equality plans are deliberately opaque to disguise unresolved conflicts with the Coalition conservatives (...) His childcare policy would leave many families better off, but its future is uncertain because he continues to insist it must be paid for by the family benefit cuts. And, astonishingly, he goes to the poll with no policies at all on higher education, vocational education, industrial relations or the arts.\n\nIt looks like Australians will be convinced to vote against their own best interests, again.\n\nPerhaps Australia will only have a good perspective on what matters if something big goes wrong, like the property bubble burst or a bank collapse. Then both majors might run on highly specific big target policies that *really* serve everyone, rather than oblique gestures to growing 'the economy' that are really just sly ways to make the rich richer."}
