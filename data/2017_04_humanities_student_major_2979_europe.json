Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. \n\n-should be obvious...\n\n **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights** - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n\n-Le Pen considered to put death penalty on a referendum.\n\n **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause** - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. \n\n-This should be pretty clear...\n\n **Supremacy of the Military** - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n-She wants to sharply increase military and police spending. They vote for her in high numbers (50 % in last election I think).\n\n **Obsession with National Security** - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n-Again clear. \n\n **Religion and Government are Intertwined** - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government[.] policies or actions. \n\n-\"We need to save our christian values\"\n\n **Obsession with Crime and Punishment** - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n\n-Again clear, especially considering what I already said about death penalty and her position on IS, refugees, etc.\n\n **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption** - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n\n-Pretty apparant when you consider the Le Pen families position in the party.\n\nThe following I could see Le Pen doing when elected:\n\n Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n\n-\n\n Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. \n\n-\n\n Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. \n\n-\n\n Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked. \n\n-\n\n Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections. \n\nBut obviously none of these if part of her programm (it would be stupid if you would promise that shit to people) but when you're in power... Things suddenly start to look different.\n\nApart from all this Le Pen is litterally a national-socialist. That should be enough already."}
