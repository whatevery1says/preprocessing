Engineering majors on Reddit (not necessarily on this subreddit) are always putting down Liberal arts_major for not choosing Engineering where you're \"guaranteed a job out of school.\" If it[.] true that you're guaranteed a job out of school, you don't have to worry about GPAs. So go ahead and challenge yourself. If I suck at Math and need to get rid of a requirement I'd rather take Math for the Liberal Arts and get an A than take Precalculus and get an F. \n\nIt[.] a very competitive job world out there. We NEED high GPAs to compete with the Ivy League kids and the kids at better schools. \n\nBelieve me, I would love to challenge myself and take hard courses that I wouldn't normally take. But I'm in college to get a job when I get out of college. And as Chartzilla said, future employers are looking at the GPA. So that[.] my most important goal at Rutgers right now -- keeping my GPA up.\n\n**TL;DR -- Getting a job now isn't as easy as it was ten-twenty years ago with a college degree. A lot of majors need a high GPA to compete in a limited job market. If easy classes are needed to keep the high GPA and get rid of requirements, so be it.**\n\n**EDIT:** I also wanted to add to the people saying you're paying good money to learn, I'm also paying good money not to fuck up just trying to fulfill a requirement."}
