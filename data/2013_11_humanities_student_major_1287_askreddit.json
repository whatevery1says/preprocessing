There is no universal standard of accounting knowledge that must be known. Lawmakers just love making laws regarding finances more complicated. Yes, you are right, an accountant of today needs more training in order to deal with the laws and stuff, but the world worked fine back when those laws didn't exist. Just because we didn't know about certain scientific principals doesn't mean that they never existed.\n\nAnyway, maybe business was a bad example. What about history? A history major may have more possible things to study, but most historians focus on a specific time period. A history degree today is probably of similar value to someone 50 years ago. Maybe they found out a few more things about <specific area but in general most of the information would be the same. In the end, historians are taught the same skills that they used to be taught.\n\nIn the end, though, humanities and arts don't need to become more expansive as time moves forward. Some things may change here and there, but the bulk of knowledge could remain mostly static because *these things were invented by humans*. Sciences, though, are absolute. We don't create them. We only seek to understand them. Thus, it stands to reason that as we learn more about the world we live in, scientists will need to spend more time learning about the laws that govern the universe."}
