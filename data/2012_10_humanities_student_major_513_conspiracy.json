You could potentially look to the aftermath of the Black Plague to get some idea of the pro and cons of a feudal system.\n\n Estimates generally put the death toll at 1/3 to 1/2 the population of Europe. \n\nWestern Europe, Britain especially, experienced dramatic social and cultural change in the century following the drastic depopulation of society. Eastern Europe had a completely different reaction to depopulation.\n\nIn Britain, there was suddenly more of everything except one key resource: laborers. But there was more room, as more land became available for farming and raising more livestock. There was more food, better food. There was room to start cultivating luxury produce instead of just the basics. But with fewer laborers available to work twice as much land it meant the lords of the manor had to provide incentives to keep their estates going. Laborers had leverage for the first time ever. Some abandonded working the land to learn skilled jobs or go to the cities. \n\nThere was more leisure time, too, since it wasn't as difficult to feed your family and have enough left to take to market. Thus there were the seeds of the Renaissance, as people began to use their imaginations and apply themselves to more than just survival.\n\nThe quality of life for laborers, and everyone else for that matter, went up considerably after the problem of overpopulation was so thoroughly, horrifically taken care of. Feudalism and serfdom were in rather quick decline in much of Western Europe.\n\nMeanwhile in Eastern Europe, instead of the laborers beginning to break free of the bonds of serfdom, they were lashed to the land even tighter than before. The was little of the upward social mobility that occurred in Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. And over the next 300 years, it was those countries which were at the center of not just *a* renaissance, *the* Renaissance. \n\nCulturally, socially, and politically, rapid development and progress occurred at this time, from the arts to philosophy to even the economy, as trading began the establishment of a \"merchant class\" which would evolve into the modern middle class. Who was doing all this? The Western Europeans, because they could.\n\n Eastern Europe had its millions still in the thrall of serfdom. Peter the Great had to \"Westernize\" his empire himself if he wanted to enjoy the art, music, literature, architecture, and culture that developed during the Renaissance. He built St. Petersburg from the ground up to be his \"Western\" city. The cultural and social revolutions and innovations that occurred in the West did not occur naturally in Eastern parts of Europe on the same time table. Most everyone there were too busy being peasants and serfs, while the nobility just copied and adopted what they could from their Western neighbors.\n\nEngland had a constitutional monarchy in place by the end of the 17th century. Conversely, Russia continued to operate via serfdom and autocratic rule until well into the 20th century. \n\nWhat does all that mean regarding your question? How would the \"elite\" benefit from a return to serfdom? I don't believe that anybody would. If \"elite\" = \"the wealthy\" well, they practically owe the development of capitalism to the *abolishment* of serfdom. We owe so much of our current civilization to mankind[.] many different coping skills. How we cope now will have repercussions we can't even fathom, just like the river of time flowing from the Black Death leading to the weakening of the power of the church and then to the Reformation and the Enlightenment, and the rise of intellectualism, the embrace of radical creative thought, and the demand for self-expressive endeavor, packaged and marketed as respected consumer goods to be bought and sold, and we invented and reinvented \"celebrities\", and one of them is Snooki.\n\nThroughout history, mankind has almost always made the choice to progress rather than regress. Serfdom didn't turn out so hot for the Eastern Europeans who chose to live by it. They practically didn't get invited to the Renaissance and wound up trailing behind for ages trying to catch up and tie their shoes at the same time. They wound up with *Communism.*\n\nI definitely don't see any benefit in going backwards, not for anyone. \n\nCan you give some examples of \"previous social systems\" which were less stable for the wealthy than today[.]? I would say that up until the agricultural changes, advent of death duties in the UK, the advent of the income tax, and WW1, the elite of the US and the UK were virtually untouchable. There was no real danger of a bloody revolution ripping apart the aristocracy like in France, there was no limit to their wealth, and there was an enormous servant class the majority of which went about their lives \"knowing their place\" and even perpetuating the social hierarchy amongst themselves. There was simply nothing that could destroy the rich but themselves, for generations.\n\nActually, i should seek clarification. What is your definition of \"the elite\", particularly as it applies to your question? If it[.] wealth, how do you define it? By a dollar value? Power, influence? What about other forms of exclusive privilege? Intelligence? Leadership? Education? Connection? Where do we draw the line and say, these people here are \"the elite\" and these people over here are the rest of us?\n\nEDIT: large amounts of content added!\n"}
