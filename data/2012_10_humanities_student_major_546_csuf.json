So let[.] try this again.\n\nFirst of all: Take her to Disneyland! It is simply a must. Or at least go to Knott[.] Berry Farm. Or both. The latter is more affordable and has faster rides. You could also just go to Downtown Disney, right by the main gate/entrance--it[.] like a big, fancy outdoor shopping mall with entertainment and a fun atmosphere. Unless you want to spend money buying her merchandise, or go to a fancy restaurant, it[.] free to walk around in. If you both like the beach, you can check out the popular beaches like Venice or Santa Monica Beach. In Venice, you get to walk around and see vendors and entertainers--it[.] a popular place for walking around, but you can do that and swim. At Santa Monica Beach, there[.] a pier with a bunch of rides, and it looks cool at night. There[.] also an outdoor shopping mall near the pier, which looks awesome at night with christmas lights on the trees, similar to the ones we have in Downtown Fullerton. \n\nCheck out the Honda Center for new shows, events, basketball games, etc. all year-round, and go to San Diego Comic Con in July (which has grown increasingly, absurdly popular over the years and is packed with nerds and non-nerds alike all the time). If you appreciate the arts, beautiful scenery and architecture, go to Balboa Park. During the day there are tons of people who enjoy the entertainers, merchants, events, and the like. In the same area, there is the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center (free or discounted for students, I cannot recall).\n\nSouth Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa is the largest mall in California, the 4th largest in the U_S, and the 26th largest in the world. It[.] so big, a smaller part of it is reached by crossing the street on a bridge (which is so cool). Even if you're not interested in shopping, just walking around and checking out the atmosphere is pretty neat. You'll find your share of snobby, rich shoppers, however, as that mall is fancy as hell. There[.] a huge annual fair that Orange County holds, which just passed but you can look up in the future, that everyone raves about. Make a trip down to the Orange County Zoo! It[.] supposed to be ten times better than the LA Zoo. \n\nThere are so many things to do down here in Orange County alone, and I know I left out so many equally cool places. And I mainly listed some of the most popular places, too. LA is also enormous, and I could list places to go to while there but man, I'm beat, haha. Let me know if you ever want to specifically check out LA and I'll give you some more ideas. :)"}
