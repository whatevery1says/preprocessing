You are doing nothing for anyone but yourselves. Desperate to be relevant so you invent genders and offenses, you create causes for the \"oppressed\" when you are in fact the oppressors. Shouting down those who would disagree with you or silencing them by intentionally taking things out of context to garner offense. Stop using privilege as a shield to excuse your petty and pathetic childlike behavior. The civilized world has survived thousands of years without the pc thought police and will continue to long after your meaningless \"movement\" is nothing more than a footnote in humanities mistakes. \n\nI do not and have not ever needed you or anyone else to tell me what to think or feel about certain topics. Weak minded individuals such as yourself however need to latch on to a hivemind like that of SRS because you're incapable of independent thought and cannot behave as society expects. So you seek out an echo chamber where all you have to do is parrot the hivemind to be accepted, something I'm guessing you and your ilk are not used to in normal social circles. \n\nHere[.] a piece of advice: \n\nGrow up. Dye your hair a normal color and get a degree that[.] actually useful. Stop being angry at the world because you decided to major in gender studies and cannot find employment. Don't find a scapegoat in \"white men\" because you make poor life choices. \n\nGood day. "}
