My husband works at a four-year liberal_arts school; the tuition[.] pretty high, and there are a lot of well-off students whose parents furnish their rooms. Maybe because it[.] a pain to move, or maybe because they don't appreciate the value of stuff they didn't buy, they throw lots of things away when they're still in great condition. During move-out week over the years, we've pulled out:\n- Literal cash (lots of coins, some bills)\n- An empty keg, which we returned for the deposit and used to buy more beer\n- Jewelry with the price tag still attached ($85 necklace, y'all!)\n- Many items of clothing and shoes, including a nice men[.] leather jacket\n- A sweet backpack I still use as a gym bag five years later\n- All kinds of food; the best was a whole gallon of cake batter ice cream that was unopened, untouched, and still somehow frozen\n- Some Percocets (older and wiser now, would not recommend taking dumpster drugs)\n- Sets of dishes \n- Big area rugs\n- Those big plastic storage bins - I keep my daughter[.] diapers in one today, how times change\n- A high chair that my dad repaired and painted for my son\n- Fans \n- Textbooks, which we sold online for several hundred dollars\n- Different kinds of furniture, especially end tables and entertainment centers"}
