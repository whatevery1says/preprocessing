We need our historians, psychologists, sociologists. We need our artists. We just won't know it until they are gone. And maybe then we won't even notice, we'll have just fallen into a new kind of dark age and future generations (if enlightened) will look back on us and pity us.\n\nI remember an economy that supported humanities degrees. I remember when people didn't have to go into extreme debt to get a degree. I remember when a humanities degree would land you a decent job. I remember when [.]tarving artists' weren't actually starving. \n\nThe economy and system is severely broken right now. And we are all suffering for it. Every one of us. Even us in highly technical trades/lucrative fields suffer from the loss of academic diversity in our society. \n\nAnd the final nail in the 'just go out and get a proper degree' coffin:\n\nNot everyone is cut out for a STEM degree. I work in higher ed, I run success analytics data, and over the past few years I've seen a massive spike in students running themselves into the ground and into extreme debt failing and retaking STEM course for degrees they simply aren't cut out for.\n\n*from my comment in another part of this thread, didn't feel like retyping*\n"}
