While I do agree that a Socratic type of teaching is often effective when dealing with the liberal_arts, but when it comes to the hard_sciences, I don't believe that a Socratic method would prove effective. Through a Socratic Cafe, one could not probably learn the basic formula F=ma or V=kq/r. This is something that you could only learn through lecture or reading. While group work may help in developing and understanding these concepts, a Socratic Cafe will not necessarily. Additionally, a school that essentially breeds Ivy League students doesn't necessarily make it a good school. Private schools generally cost a lot of money but they can establish connections to admission officers in the Ivy League school. Take a talented student from a public school that offers advanced programs like AP or IB and a talented student from that private school, it[.] likely they'll have a similar level of intelligence. It[.] a common stereotype to suggest that Ivy League students are smarter than public university students. I've met some Harvard and Yale students... and they were not necessarily the brightest. So I think ultimately that a teaching method should center around the topic. I believe that lectures/labs are necessary for the sciences while a Socratic Cafe is good for the liberal_arts such as literature and philosophy."}
