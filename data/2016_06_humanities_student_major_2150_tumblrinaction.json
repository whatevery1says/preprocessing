I was in college at Wesleyan University, a very left liberal_arts women[.] university, and my professor was trying to get us riled up and have a big debate about gender, race, and class. He brought in the statistics that 2 in 5 women are sexually assaulted in this country and he was like, \"There are 10 women in this class that means four women in this class statistically speaking have been raped.\"\nYou could just feel that all the women in the class felt so confronted and that could very well be true and really triggering. I felt like he thought it was this big learning moment for everybody like, deal with the reality, deal with the world, why aren't you outraged by this? He kept going how does that make you feel, and no one said anything.\nThen, I finally said, \"I'll tell you how it makes me feel. Really angry because I don't want to hear about who was raped. There[.] three male students in the class and you. So I want to know if four people raped, which one of you raped us? Because once someone is raped it[.] already fucking happened, but if we talk about the other thing and make the boys feel uncomfortable and say if those are the statistics, then statically speaking someone in this room raped us. Let[.] talk about that.\"\n\nThis explains everything "}
