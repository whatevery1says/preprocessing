Eventually I realized that I was learning absolutely ZERO job skills. When I asked my department head about it I was told, \"Our program is a research based program. We're teaching you all how to be researchers.\" Great! That[.] exactly what I was told would be happening! \n\nSo yeah, it[.] real easy now that I'm older and actually understand how this shit works to look back and see how stupid it was to get a Communication degree. But when your entire life you're told you HAVE to go to college and get a degree if you want any worthwhile job, that[.] what you fucking do. Throw in the fact that most of us were 18 when we made that decision and now you have a bunch of 30-somethings that were too young and dumb to understand the choices they actually made. "}
