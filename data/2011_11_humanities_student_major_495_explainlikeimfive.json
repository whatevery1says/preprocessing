"content_scrubbed": "kids are usually enrolled into \"kindergarten\" at age 5, though they can attend preschool before this on a voluntary basis. they then move through \"grades,\" which are years in school, after completing kindergarten.\n\nschools are generally divided into segments, with the first being \"elementary\" school, with kindergarten through 4th grade, 5th grade or in some cases 6th grade. \"high\" school is 9th grade to 12th grade, and \"middle\" school picks up wherever elementary leaves off and continues to high school. high school graduation is the bare minimum of american education, and if you drop out you can get an equivalent called a GED, or general equivalency degree, although high school dropouts almost never amount to much for obvious reasons.\n\nafter high school comes \"college,\" \"university,\" or trade school, depending on what you want to study. completely voluntary, and almost all of them charge thousands of dollars tuition, plus room and board, books, fees, and all manner of other ways to snag your money. it[.] possible to get grants and scholarships to offset or completely cover the cost of your education if you're an exceptional student, or a promising student-athlete going to a school with a strong sports program.\n\npeople say the system is failing because americans by and large aren't concerned with education. popular culture disregards it, teachers are not engaged in the process, and there are multiple levels of disconnect between people who want to see the schools improve, people who have good ideas about how to improve them, and the people in a position to actually enact those changes.\n\nour last president, george w. bush, had a pet program called \"no child left behind,\" which had incentive funding for schools that got good scores on standardized tests. now there are a number of reasons that[.] a terrible idea, but one of my favorites is that we were comparing america to countries like japan where standardized test scores are traditionally astronomical. this is a bad idea because american schools tend to focus more on critical thinking and problem solving where japanese schools focus on hard math and science learning, with an emphasis on rote learning as a technique.\n\ntwo of the most profound ill effects of NCLB were firstly that there were many benchmark tests and whatnots that without successful completion a student could not graduate, with no exceptions. otherwise intelligent people being rolled back grades and having their diploma withheld because of black-and-white rules is just bad policy, at least in my opinion. secondly, standardized test scores shouldn't be the objective of education, and many schools with poor test scores simply \"taught to the test,\" that is forewent any peripheral teaching or subjects that weren't on the test, taught test-taking strategies, and generally only spent time on improving their test scores, and any actual learning that took place was an unintended side effect. because of this narrow-minded and ignorant policy (it really is. it[.] my opinion, but prove me wrong) things like the arts have suffered dramatically.\n\nmy high school went from having a fully-functioning band (concert, marching and jazz), orchestra (with two orchestras), and choir (show and concert) programs, each with their own teacher, to having one teacher and one program per. art teachers have been cut dramatically also, theater, any kind of extracurricular that doesn't directly relate to improving standardized testing scores has been slashed in a heinous fashion and with the american budget situation laying as it is, it doesn't look like we're ever getting our music back.\n\nanother neat thing is the budget and economical situation. our teachers sometimes are not all they could be, and this is for an obvious reason. we don't pay our teachers enough to attract the best and brightest, because we simply don't put enough money into education, and our policy about what to do with money in education is off-target also. any time a school system gets a little extra money in their budget they buy new computers or renovate old buildings, and it[.] left up to the teachers' unions to negotiate pay raises, which is upsetting because some politicians are pushing for new laws to weaken public employee unions.\n\ncollective bargaining as we have it means that all of the teachers get together and say, school system, we all want 10% pay raises or we're all leaving and good luck replacing us (arbitrary number). taking that away from them makes each teacher responsible for his/her own career and in that way weakens their ability to negotiate their pay and benefits. so we've cut their pay and in the same motion cut their ability to argue for more pay. small wonder president obama asked colleges to encourage 100,000 more students to become teachers; no one wants that for a job. 12+ hour days 5 days a week for $40,000/year, and you only have a job for 9 months out of the year.\n\nany other questions i'd be glad to answer, sorry it isn't exactly at a 5-year old level. also, sorry it[.] broken up into weird blocks, i just put in line breaks wherever so you could take a breather in between thoughts"}
