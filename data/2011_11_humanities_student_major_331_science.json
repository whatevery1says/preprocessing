I realized they probably make up 90% of these dropouts... but I already read 10 years ago that 1/3 of all College freshmen drop out.  Not sure if that is still current (or why it wouldn't be), but I don't know how significant 40% is compared to other fields.\n\nI've graduated with an comp. sci. degree, and done my share of liberal_arts course and agree they are eaiser... but often the worst teachers I have had were in the technical and math courses (I often just taught myself).  Even if they spoke great English, they were sometimes as eccentric as the students - can't interact worth a damn or get it across in plain english.  (This is even more important with assignments than with course material.)  And I met a lot of eccentric students who were great at it their fields... but just couldn't deal with regimentation at all.  And I'm working with a guy under me who is way more brilliant than me, but is a 1st year dropout.\n\nThe fact is that college isn't for everyone, and those that can't hack it shouldn't automatically be assumed losers.  I often have to have spats with HR because they want to keep replacing the aforementioned worker with \"someone with a degree\".  Nevermind the candidates have a piece of paper and couldn't program beyond hello world without it taking all night."}
