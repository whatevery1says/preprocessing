I started out in strategy consulting, then CRO software, then healthcare, and now in life science sales. Project management, Regulatory, Sales, Product Marketing, Operations, Process, QA/QC, jeez. And what[.] wrong with research?\n\nEG 2 - It[.] important to support the arts. Even if there isn't much money in it, doesn't mean there isn't a lot of value in itt. And \"theater arts\" degrees aren't common at most top 200 schools. If you're going to Conservatory to be an artist and major in it, it[.] because you've got some talent and will contribute to culture with it.\n\nEG 3 - I don't even understand what category this is supposed to represent. Most of the PS majors I knew went on to become lawyers and now they're all pulling in $300k+. I'd think that[.] quite a good use of a degree.\n\nEG 4 - I don't understand what a \"prereq major\" is. You can be any major you want to apply to medical school as long as you've taken the prereqs. The prereqs tend to already be the core curriculum of most biology related majors so that[.] the easiest path but as in my response to EG 1, there are PLENTY of other routes to go if you don't want to be a doctor.\n\n"}
