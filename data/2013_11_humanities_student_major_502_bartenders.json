Come on sweetheart, I'm 4 months from getting a double major in physics and astronomy with honors and I doubt I'll be able to find a career job RIGHT AWAY, if ever. A degree doesn't guarantee you a job, that[.] a reality that a lot of kids these days don't seem to grasp. This probably sounds pessimistic and bitter, but undergrad degrees, especially those in arts are pretty much on par with what a high school degree was 30 years ago - everyone has one. \nFor me, if I don't land a job as a research assistant right off the bat and work my way up the ladder, I can either teach highschool or go to Graduate School so I can get a better job, not ideal but that[.] just the way the world works.\n\nSecond, this is clearly her first job. Shocker that there are mean scary people out there beyond the sacred hallowed halls of knowledge and higher learning. Everywhere you work there are going to be assholes and bigots, from construction to academia and everywhere in between you're going to run into someone who works above you that you would love to waterboard for one reason or the other. \n\nThe level of self righteousness in this paper made me sick, sort of fitting though for a girl who spent at least 4 years of her life in Montreal though. \n\n/rant\n\nExuent"}
