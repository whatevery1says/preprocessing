There were reasons for it 2000+ years ago but we're beyond it now. We need to grow up and abandon childish ignorant nonsense. In that regard i couldn't care less if a believer respects my stance on religion or acceptance of science and what we know about the natural world. They are welcome to try and disprove it if they like, but the vast majority of our understanding stands on it[.] own. Unlike them i don't need the approval of others to think for myself or make decisions. I also refuse to \"understand\" or accept backwards ignorant thinking that ultimately leads to division and violence. If you don't like it you are welcome to sit quietly on the sideline and let others do the work, but don't try and tell us to shut-up. Non-believers have shut-up for thousands of years because our lives were on the line when we didn't. That[.] changed and there[.] no way people of reason should shut-up now. Religions days of immunity to criticism are gone forever and they aren't coming back. Feel free to not visit this sub to make yourself feel more compatible with those that believe in imaginary friends. You're welcome to your opinion and even to voice it, but you should understand that in the eyes of many here, you're plain wrong. "}
