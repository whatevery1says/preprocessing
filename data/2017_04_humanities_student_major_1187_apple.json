I know I'd laugh them out of the competition at that point- I need the thing to be a powerhouse, running multiple VMs and emulating production environments, storing massive amounts of data and accessing it through multiple methods. \n\nI have no problem with Apple releasing a high-powered consumer device for people with too much money who want 'the best thing out there', but when you start tacking 'pro' on the end of it, that implies a powerhouse machine with functionality outside the consumer space. I need a top of the line discrete GPU, the ability to pop in more RAM in a few months when my virtualization needs grow, a crazy huge battery to keep that thing trucking along, and storage I can swap out on a whim.\n\nWhat I don't need is an Apple Watch glued at the top of the keyboard replacing the function keys I've used my entire life, and a hobbled machine. It[.] sad that Dell has a system I can expand, contract, and customize more than Apple[.] 'pro' line- which seems now to be just a system for wealthy college kids in liberal_arts majors who want a big screen."}
