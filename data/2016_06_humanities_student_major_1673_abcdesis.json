I'm not saying I think anyone was let in just because of affirmative action (actually, my major was entirely white except for me and 1 other East_Asian person). I understand that everyone at my school is pretty much equally qualified to be there (most probably more qualified than me)\n\nWhat I meant was that I think I benefited from getting to learn about the racism and issues affecting other races which I didn't get from my high school, which had almost no black or latino people. I just mentioned my area of study since that type of learning doesn't directly relate to it like it might for some humanities_major, but I still think it made the college as a whole better in terms of students having a wide variety of perspectives on things.\n\nIf you're going on the \"aa is bad because it makes people assume black people were just handed the job/admission\", that[.] the fault of people being racist, not affirmative action. I know from talking to friends of mine at UC schools where they dont practice aa that loads of people still make assumptions about the black/latino students intelligence and qualifications regardless. People are gonna be racist no matter what, especially more so if that race is an even smaller minority, that[.] not a good argument."}
