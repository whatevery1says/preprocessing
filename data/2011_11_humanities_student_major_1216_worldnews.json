A lot of them are raised to see women as servants or worse and this just makes my blood boil. As another example, I go to a small liberal_arts school that has a language school on campus as well that caters to a number of Arabic students. They are consistently harass and are disrespectful to the girls at my school. Last year two of these visiting language students went into an unlocked girls dorm room late one saturday night and tried to get in bed with them and take advantage of them while they were asleep. It drives me insane that I have to share this planet (and especially my school) with these men who think do not have to respect women and can treat them however they see fit. Most of the Arab kids studying at my school are from very wealthy families and are therefore probably worse than average, but that is no excuse. I try not to be a racist, and have travelled in the middle east (Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Israel) and I know that it is not the Arabic nature of these men that makes them act this way because the majority of them are not like this, but the culture over there that allows this sort of mind set to develop is simply unacceptable to me."}
