The overproduction of PhDs is hardly a \"humanities problem\" as it is so commonly (mis)represented in the popular press. The real problem, of course, is that the very nature of the academic industry is so variegated and the timelines are so long, any efficient \"tracking\" becomes a real exercise in futility. Post-PhD placement? Well, postdocs? VAPs? TT? Within 1 year? 3? 5? These are the issues that popular accounts rarely address.\n\nAnd you are right. I too felt that Shanton really chose more of a public humanities approach, which is perfectly fine, but not really a good example of \"Humanities PhD sucks!\"\n\nFinally, I think the lack of public awareness of how much program matters toward placement is because of the deeper prevalent American myth of equality and democracy. We would perhaps like to believe all PhDs are equal? I don't know, but I suspect that[.] an (oversimplified) representation of the prevailing attitude. Bluntly, that[.] wrong, and the sooner this is accepted, the better things will be all around. Programs need to be chosen with care. Not all programs are equal. And yes, prestige and reputation matter, because (at least in part) they are deserved. Obviously, I'm specifically talking about reputation *within academia* rather than silly USNWR reports and the like.\n\nI really wish we within academia--students and faculty--were more outspoken about such matters.
