My younger sister gets all the A grades, all the academic praise and I'm stuck with the mundane B and C grades. But then while she[.] training to be a doctor and going down the science route, I've decided, 'good for her, I hate science now I'm going to get on with what I want to do...' That being art and writing. She[.] good at science, I'm good at the arts. (I also have all my artwork hanging about so I can rub it in Mwahahahaha!)\n\nBut seriously, when there are days that she[.] seemingly doing better than me, making better comebacks at me and somehow (not always directly) putting me down, I just focus on what I'm good at, stay out of her way as she does out of mine and know that there are things I can do which she can't... Even if she does make more money than me being a doctor while I live the life of a Bohemian... sounds a lot less stressful job than hers I can tell you. \n\nbe happy for your brother, be happy for yourself and screw other people, they *wish* they could be in the highly stressful, short deadline, backstabbing industry of film making (... well perhaps not backstabbing), but you're doing what you love (or find what you love) and so is your brother. So get on with it. \n\nP. S You a student still! OF COURSE your not as successful as your brother yet! The world is still your oyster!"}
