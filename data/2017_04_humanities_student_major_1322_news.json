What about the doctor who has to take out $250K in loans and wants to work in a lower paying field like Emergency Triage instead of in private practice.  Maybe you should stop thinking that only liberal_arts students are the ones burdened by debt, almost every college student is burdened with debt, some are lucky and get a high paying job in STEM but they are not the majority.\n\nAlso expecting an 18 year old with no education on how financial matters work, thanks public education system, to make a financial decision that will impact a huge portion of their adult life is predatory and stupid.  Making a stupid decision to get a bad degree at 18-22 should not make your life a miserable hell for the next 20 years, if you make a stupid purchase on a car you can file for bankruptcy, if you start a business and fail you can go bankrupt, same with everything but medical and student loan debt.  In my opinion two key factors in a functioning society are health and education, if we are making both nearly inaccessible to those without the financial means then we are not a well functioning society."}
