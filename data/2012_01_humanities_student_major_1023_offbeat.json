So, it wasn't a stunning pillar of intellect, but it was well above the national average.\n\nI had an AP English teacher who refused to teach. 5 days a week, we came into class, and either took a test, or spent the class time grading our own tests from the previous day.\n\nI had a history teacher who gave up on our class one year, and spend the second semester teaching the history of rock and roll, rather than the curriculum (he was actually one of my favorite teachers, though).\n\nFor our school paper, which was published monthly, we had an actual class hour daily for it. I spent four days a week playing flash games and listening to music. I was one of the editors, and ended up writing half the paper most months, because as lazy as I was, the other students were worse.\n\nOur substitute teachers never even tried to teach us anything, or follow any sort of lesson plan. Substitute teacher day meant \"we get to play on laptops\" day. And I was almost exclusively in honors and AP classes. The people I went to school with are now scattered across the nation, at Berkeley, Stanford, Chicago, Boston, Pomona (#1 liberal_arts college in the nation), etc.\n\nWhat kind of school district do you work in where they actually do have lesson plans?"}
