I mean isn't that pretty much every robotic movie plot? \n\nHumanity creates AI to help humans. AI decides the best way to help humans is to save them from themselves. So, the human race is enslaved, and the machines continue on trying to do the best they can to help humanity. \n\nIn the Matrix, the machines are keeping humans alive, giving them a place to occupy their minds, and keeping their bodies free from any true physical harm. The biochemical battery/processor thing was just the machines trying to be efficient, I mean the space was already occupied by a human body, why not harvest it[.] energy. As for Zion, the machines are trying to let the humans rebuild, trying to let the humans save themselves. But, the humans are so bent on war that the machines periodically have to wipe the city and start over. The majority of the humans have the same skin tone to reduce racial fighting amongst the humans, and realistically at some point in the future, we will all have the same hue anyway.\n\nNeo and his shipmates didn't actually exist, they represented humanities incessant need to create deities to save them, rather than rising up and realizing they are capable of saving themselves. Which is another reason Zion gets periodically wiped. The inhabitants deify the One, then become belligerently bent on the war they are so fond of.\n\n\n\n......\nAnd that was my interpretation if the matrix."}
