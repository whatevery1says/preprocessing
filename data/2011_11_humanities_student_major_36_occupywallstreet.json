I lived my first nine years in Palestine (That[.] why I invest so heavily Palestinian micro finance; they're my brothers). When my dad was shot and died, my mom took my brother and me and moved to the U_S with her sister where we grew up. My much beloved wife passed away from pancreatic cancer, and so I donate a lot to companies working for cures on that. I live in NY currently, which is why I give money to NY soup kitchens because it[.] been shown over and over again that people who are hungry/malnourished cannot learn and lose their potential. \n\nI payed my way through college by going to an inexpensive community college on scholarship and worked as a night janitor to support my mom and brother. This had the added advantage of giving me time to work on my programming at night because they let me use the computer lab of the building that I cleaned after I was done.\n\nIt can be really hard to make ends meet as a person in your position, but it can be done. I'd like to say it only takes hard_work, but it takes some luck, and a lot of talent. If you're majoring in humanities, you're pretty much fucked. I wish you luck, though. "}
