They also all have a limit on how many credits you can take in one semester, making it hard to fill all of the requirements for more than one major at a time. And with the way you're registered, if you're listed under one major, you often can't take classes for another one without submitting a special form at the time of class registration.\n\nNot all schools make you choose your major right off the bat, but most of them seem to do so (that was a sales point at one school when I was looking; \"We allow students who don't know what they want to do to spend a year in the 'I don't know what I want to do' department\"), which means when you apply to a university you're really applying to a specific department. Not just \"Liberal Arts\" but \"Liberal Arts - Humanities - Literature\" kind of thing.\n\nI looked at 7 or 8 schools in my prefecture and they were all run the same way. No one at my current school has a double major, and none of my friends outside of school are double majoring/graduated with a double major either."}
