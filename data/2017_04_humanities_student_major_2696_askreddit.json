The atmosphere was ineffable, the faculty impeccable and fascinating, and the other students were all uniquely interesting and kind. It focused heavily on the arts, student-driven drama/musical/dance productions, and expanding artistic expertise. Fights and bullying were rare - students spent their time developing lifelong friendships and creating masterpieces. There was a drug culture that existed but it always seemed safe and low-key. (It[.] possible that this is a skewed memory and not based on truth, I'm not sure.) \n\nI was so lucky to have such a peaceful place to go everyday and grow as a person. Unfortunately, depression is capable of taking people away from the most joyous of situations. I never felt able to leave the house and dropped out in my last year.  I regret not solidifying more deep friendships and totally immersing myself in everything the school had to offer. I don't allow myself to consider myself an artist now because I never excelled the way other students did. I regret not continuing to refine my drawing skills and I regret shying away from performances. I could have taken my skills into studying architecture like I have always dreamed. I could have gained some confidence. \n\nThankfully, I snapped the hell out of it about 4 years after leaving and got my shit together. I went back to high school as an adult and took bland compulsory credits. I learned that math and science came easily to me and I thought I could mash all my interests together into architecture finally. Not drawing since high school bit me in the ass and I fell ass backwards into engineering. I have no idea where the hell my education is taking me but I'm enjoying it. I suppose engineering is creative in its own right. A few more semesters to go and I'll be done my degree. My confidence is building each year but I'm still yet to have the damn time to start drawing again. \n\nI have learned to embrace regrets as \"lessons\". Try to stop and appreciate what you have. Try to remind yourself to keep up with what you love. Get as much help as possible if you are able to notice that mental illness is getting in the way of achieving the things you want. If anyone in high school now is reading this, know that whatever mistakes you make can be fixed or forgotten. Life is long but there[.] still no time for regrets.  "}
