I feel like I would have liked it better. Not that I haven't liked Berkeley, but the campus can feel very impersonal at times. You have to work harder to create a smaller world. Also my department, Econ, has huge classes (like 200+ kids) even in the upper division electives which probably makes it worse than some other majors. However, I still think Berkeley was the_right choice given the prices involved. \n\nI don't think that UCLA (I was admitted to every UC) would have been very different though in this area.\n\nTo respond to some of the other criticism here: \n\n* The far leftists make a lot of noise but honestly most people just make fun of them in private. That being said, myself and most of my friends have realized that they actually do have a point in some areas, it[.] just that they over do it. Being exposed to different ideas (which I still disagree with) has made me grow and be more tolerant. None of my professors have been like this though.\n* Academics hasn't been that hard for me, and I have a decent GPA. Generally, Econ is considered to be one of the harder departments but I think it[.] not as cut throat as other majors. I've felt that the few humanities classes I've taken have been a lot of reading although not that hard if you actually do it and participate in discussions, but very personally rewarding in expanding my worldview."}
