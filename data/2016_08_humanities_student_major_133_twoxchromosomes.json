I don't regret working there at all. Gave me an insight into life sciences most software people don't get. It wasn't a poor experience. People are people.\n\nAlso, we generalize all the time. There is no avoiding it. You just have to put that aside and treat individuals as individuals.\n\nmine lectures humanities, empathy, gender, race, and all manors or critical thinking ad nauseum.\n\nMed school humanities and humanities humanities are two very different things. A typical pre-med college student just isn't going to have the same experience as a theater major. I have engineering degrees. We have the same problem.\n\nMedical education and medicine as a whole has all kinds of problems. It is not a positive environment. It does not make people better human beings. It is also this way for all kinds of reasons and there is no easy way to change it.  In the end you still need to go to the doctor when you are sick. Probably the most gratitude I have ever felt was being sick and having a doctor available to treat me.\n\nLife is not perfect or pretty. I don't think that anyone is served by pretending that it is.\n\n\n\n"}
