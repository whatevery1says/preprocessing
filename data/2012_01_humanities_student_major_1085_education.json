The difference between high school and previous school (elementary and middle school) is mostly that the courses students can take vary. You can choose some electives (such as art, music, drama), and if you are more advanced in a particular subject you can take more advanced classes. In order to graduate you have to complete a certain number of classes in different subjects, as well as pass an exit exam (at least in California). Then, to be admitted to a four-year university, you have to take the SAT or ACT standardized test.\n\nAP (Advanced Placement) courses are usually taken in the last two years of high school, and are entirely optional. They sometimes count for college* credit. Even when they don't count, they can make you a more competitive applicant to more selective universities.\n\nA major is essentially your area of study at a university. A minor is a secondary area that you may choose to study.\n\nLiberal Arts is a major at many colleges. Generally the perception is that Liberal Arts is your major when you don't really know what you want to study.\n\nThere[.] a lot more stuff, but that[.] the gist of it, I think.\n\n*in the US \"college\" and \"university\" is interchangeable... I know they're different in the UK so I didn't want to confuse you"}
