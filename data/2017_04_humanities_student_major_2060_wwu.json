My name is Lizzie, I am a Student Admissions Representative (StAR) for the Office of Admissions and I will be answering your questions! \n\nFirst off a little about myself:\n\nI am a second year student at WWU and I am studying Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing and minoring in User Experience Design. I work for Admissions as a StAR and as the social media assistant! (Shameless promo: add us on snapchat @wwuadmissions and follow us on Twitter @wwuadmit). I was just selected to be the VP of Digital Marketing and Web Design for the Student Marketing Association (SMA). When I am not in class or working I spend a lot of my time trying new restaurants in Bellingham, hanging out with my friends, or going up to Vancouver, Canada! I am originally from Kirkland, WA (about an hour and fifteen minutes south). I picked Western because I wanted to go to a mid-sized liberal_arts school and WWU was just far enough away to where my parents don't come visit every weekend but just close enough to where I can go home and bug my 16 year old sister if I need to. \n \nI am really looking forward to answering all your questions! This AMA is supposed to be geared towards prospective students and is being put on by the Office of Admissions so I may not have every answer, but for all the questions I don't have answers to I will do my best to find an answer!\n"}
