I went to a small, liberal_arts school that was very well regarded in my state and I hated it there.  The people were incredibly serious, there was not much of thriving social scene and because it was so small the only way to really meet people was through fraternities (which I had no interest in joining).  I really tried to fit in, joining several clubs and making a concerted effort to talk to people in class, the cafeteria, gym, etc.  It just wasn't happening, I just couldn't make a connection with the people there.\n\nAfter my first year, I reapplied to my top choice and got in.  It was an easy decision to switch from a place where I had really no friends or social connections and go to the school I really wanted to.  It remains one of the best decisions I ever made because I went to a school that was much larger, had a more diverse student body and a thriving social experience.  I met lifelong friends there and got a top-quality education.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable after a few weeks it might just be an adjustment period, but if you still feel like you don't fit in with the people or are a part of the school, it might be time to investigate transferring.
