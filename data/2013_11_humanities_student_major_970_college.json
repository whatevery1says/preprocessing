You can find that below. However, I really think you should start off with your question. It is not clear whether you are worried about acceptance or wondering whether you will be considered a transfer student or not. If they are both of concern to you then you should clarify that. Also, the person you are writing to is probably pretty busy. Start off with a TL;DR and allow them to skim the specifics if they want. Finally, what do you mean about the \"tight business orientated schedule?\" Good luck!\n\n\nDear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am xxxxx, a 19 year old Austrian aspiring to go to xxxxxx University. Your website was helpful in answering many of my questions regarding the application process; however, I would be very grateful if you could answer a specific inquiry.\nI am sorry to add private details to this email, but I strongly feel that they are essential to assessing my situation. Due to a shoulder injury I was declared unfit to complete the Austrian mandatory military service, a duty every Austrian male is subject to after his graduation from secondary education. I wanted to gain crucial life experience before I headed off to college. As a result I took the initiative and decided to do an exchange year in the U_S instead. The upcoming eleven months will be an important experience and I have come to a decision: I want to continue my studies in the U_S. Upon my return, I started to search for colleges and began to work on my college application. Meanwhile, I matriculated at the Vienna University of Economics and Law to make the most of my time.\nNow I find myself confronted with the fact that though I haven't earned any credits at my current University, xxxxxx University considers me a transfer student.\nI don't see myself continuing the tight business orientated schedule and rather embrace the opportunities of a liberal_arts education at xxxxx University.\nI am afraid that my experience might be detrimental to my chances of being accepted.\nCould you please tell me if I have to fill out the CommonApp as a transfer or first year student? Besides, how would being a transfer student affect my life at xxxx University if I haven't earned any credits yet?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nxxxxxxxxx\n"}
