A lot of people like to talk crap about how there[.] no career option for anyone in the non-sciences. IMO, it[.] largely BS. You just need to realize this is not the 50[.], and there won't be a \"clear path\" for you to take after graduation. But if you are creative and resourceful you can make a living doing almost anything that you're dedicated to. \n\nI don't think it[.] a bad idea to try to live off the grid - I think it[.] a bad idea to do it now. It sounds like you need to switch majors to something you care more about. And I know you don't like math, but the number one thing that can take a humanities graduate from \"low employment prospects\" to \"hired right out of college\" are quantitative, programming, and technology skills. You're gonna need to pick at least one mathy skill and get good at it - regardless of what career you have. Saying \"no\" to both math and computers is career suicide these days, you need to pick at least one to incorporate into your skill set. \n\nDon't give up - this part of your 20[.] is challenging for everyone. Finding a path in life is not easy but if you're dedicated and smart, you WILL find a way!"}
