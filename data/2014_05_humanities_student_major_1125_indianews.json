I am against people preaching with ZERO accomplishments.\n\n Are you for people accepting stories as you have been told? Is it not possible that the masses were wrong?\n\nYOU, sir, are accepting the story as SHE is telling it. As numerous Tehelka/Kafila/Caravan/EPW have been selling it.\n\nOh, she spent *a little time a slum*? Oh, then excuse me. She[.] a master on the topic. Did she make it out of the slum on her own? Is she providing people with the means to make money to make it out of the slum? Is she even inspiring the poor to help themselves? Oh, sorry, she is lecturing in air conditioned halls of western academia, charging money by the hour and transport besides, to lecture humanities students how evil and oppressive the Indian government is, how awesome naxalites are, how Hindus are evil, and how poverty is great!\n\nGreat! I think I'll go buy her book! Wait. I already did. A whole bunch. And all of them go on and on about the same ~~bullshit~~ narrative as her speeches.\n\nSir, I see you cited her bio. Her rebellious youth. How she scorned her caste, class, power, money, and fame privileges. Excellent. Her stupid adolescent rebellion now serves as a basis for her entire life? Her fucking around with a slum dude is a laurel?\n\nFuck her. And fuck anyone who thinks that because she wrote a good book of fiction she has any intellectual validity in serious SERIOUS things like poverty."}
