This is nice information to have, but it[.] not vital.\n\nPeople who are getting priced out of their neighborhood care. And those people are overwhelmingly people of color. And the people pricing them out are overwhelmingly white and upper-middle to upper class. Things you would discover and research when you study the humanities. \n\nThe free market economy? I don't understand what you're trying to get athere.\n\nSame as above, among other things. The Free Market Economy hasn't been doing people of color any favors. \n\nFree market economy decides these things! Also, the people who are trained in the concept and usage of such things as energy consumption and engineering- aka, non-humanities_major.\n\nI don't understand what you mean when you say Free Market Economy. You refer to it like it is a rational entity making decisions.\n\nYou are also ignoring the political and economic factors which affect decision making around energy solutions. We are currently in a climate crisis, but we are not moving to curb carbon emission quickly enough. Why isn't the Free Market Economy fixing tat? \n\nSTEM fields can only show you how to build a solar farm, they cannot show you why more pipelines are being built instead. \n\nWait, are you claiming that the entire Civil Rights Movement is because of humanities_major?\n\nUm... no. When did I say that?\n"}
