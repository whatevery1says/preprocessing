Both schools offer great educations, but my opinion is that Notre Dame can provide a better, more worldly college experience that will ultimately be able to open more doors for you in the long run.\n\nI obtained a degree in physics (and have since completed a PhD in astronomy elsewhere), and can speak to the University[.] active pursuit of growing their sciences and science research output.  Since I was a student, they've built a beautiful new engineering building and I can only assume that they are similarly pursuing growth there, too.\n\nMy sense is that Purdue[.] focus specifically on engineering leaves something lacking in other STEM fields, if you were interested in branching out.  When I enrolled I was on the fence between physics and aerospace engineering, and ultimately I was very glad that I had the option to do either and be satisfied with my education in either case.\n\nAlso, I was involved with an engineering project (the group wanted the perspective of a physics student) that showed me that there were lots of opportunity to collaborate amongst STEM fields, if that interests you.\n\nOverall I'd say the breadth of educational opportunities afforded to you by Notre Dame in the humanities and the arts (I was also heavily involved with music) is difficult to pass up on.  Either way it sounds like you've got good opportunities, so best of luck to you!"}
