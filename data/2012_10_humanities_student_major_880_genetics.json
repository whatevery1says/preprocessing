S. in Biology with a Chem minor. Did undergraduate research for scholarship requirements/beer money from Fall 2001-Fall 2004. Graduated and went to graduate school for my Ph. D. in Biological Sciences. My projects were based heavily in molecular genetics of fungi, and I learned a lot about \"old school\" genetic engineering techniques. Currently, I'm a postdoc at a LARGE R1 institution in its Genetics department, where I'm slowly working on becoming a top-tier gene hacker. So some things:\"\n\n1) Your major doesn't really matter that much. Your major will just give you the background to understand the really important stuff, which is found in the form of journal articles. Science is living and dynamic, and you have to keep up with it.\n\n2) A BS won't cut it. A Masters degree MIGHT cut it. But basically, you'll be a lab tech, and thus will be completely dispensable in academia. You could try industry, as the field of synthetic biology is heating up, but you WILL be competing against people with Doctorates and five years in the field (i. e. me).\n\n3) My experience with transfer students at my undergrad and grad universities is that such policies vary WIDELY between institutions, so it'll be hard to say what your particular school wants/needs.\n\nHope that helps. Feel free to message me if you have questions and want more detailed responses. "}
