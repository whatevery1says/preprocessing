For Duke, I would just get in touch with one of their faculty; they'll either teach you themselves, or pass you off to one of their students. UNC and UNCSA both have community music programs that should be able to place you with a teacher, but they will take a cut of what you pay, so the price may be higher. Someone below mentioned private lessons costing \"an arm and a leg, as much as $40 an hour\"! First of all, LOL. I would consider $40/hour a bargain. (I pay $180 and, if I taught privately, I would charge $60.) Luckily, you don't need a top-tier teacher, you just need someone to show you the ropes, and pretty much anyone you'll find through the above channels will be able to do that. Just know that the going rate varies based on your market, but there are ways to lower the cost if you're worried about it. You can take 30-minute lessons (which most beginners do, but they're children with short attention spans), or you can take them more intermittently, like every other week or once a month. Hopefully you'll be able to keep yourself motivated in between lessons if you choose to go that route."}
