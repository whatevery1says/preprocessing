I agree, not everybody can do both, but I would claim that the human brain is flexible enough that, given the complete elimination of one side (which really, I hate doing this whole \"aligning people as math or not math\" technique but here we are), the other side could and would fill it in some way or another. I am a STEM person, but I do believe I am competent enough in my analytical skills, critical thinking and reading. If I was called upon or inspired to become a \"humanities major\" job, I feel I could. Similarly, I think that many humanities_major, given proper training, could become engineers; they just choose not to, for whatever reason.\n\nI think the only point of difference that I can find between the two groups is the difference in levels of education given to both sides *for the other side*. That is, you can't become an engineering major without doing at least a few English classes (rudimentary though they may be); you can, however, get through a Philosophy major without ever touching Calculus or Physics. That[.] why I had to put in the qualifier \"with some training\". \n\nPersonally, I loved my Art_History, Psychology, and English classes that I chose to take in college. However, I just felt compelled to go to the sciences and become a doctor. How much energy did *you* invest in the sciences before rejecting them ?"}
