Obviously CS at Stanford is top notch, but you really gotta factor in the fact that it sits in Silicon Valley. If you want to end up there after graduation, go to Stanford. A Stanford CS degree pretty much guarantees you a job in the area these days. (Doing CS at Columbia is still noteworthy and will resonate in the Bay Area, but right now the Stanford name does have a ring to it in SV.) I always got the sense that Columbia was a bit less community oriented since it sits in the middle of the city. Since Stanford is its own campus 30+ miles out from SF, everything happens on campus and you definitely get a strong community vibe. Double majoring at Stanford is difficult, however pursuing two different subjects (but not for two degrees) is insanely easy. The logistics of double majoring is difficult because of the units, but taking classes in different departments/school is encouraged at Stanford.\n\nI think really the question comes down to if you want more of an East_Coast or West Coast vibe. Columbia is an ivy, strong humanities core, in NYC, with a campus feel that[.] more preppy and established. Stanford is an interdisciplinary school where you have quite a bit of leeway to take what you want, in CA, and has a campus feel that[.] more laid back and free-spirited. \n\n(Obviously take any Columbia comments with a grain of salt since I didn't go there.)"}
