He had two internships during summers in college, one at the company he works at now, and one at another well known place (PM me if you want to know more details). He also got accepted to UCLA, but decided on Cal Poly because he felt like the school was a better fit for him, and he just liked it more. \n\nHe gets paid well. Starting salary out of college was about $100k, and that was four years ago. However, in Silicon Valley, a low six figure salary is basically what you need to get by to rent a one bedroom apartment alone, unless you want to live someplace cheaper and have a nightmare commute or live with roommates. \n\nJob wise, he has definitely had a much easier time than I did after graduating with a liberal_arts degree. But it[.] worth mentioning that programming is his passion. He[.] been contributing to open source projects since high school, and that[.] actually how he got recruited for his first internship. \n\nIn the end, where you go to school doesn't matter, as long as you attend an accredited program and do well in school. My husband once interviewed a Stanford PhD student for a position at the company he works at now. The guy didn't get a job offer. \n"}
