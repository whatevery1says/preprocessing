I'm a history major, currently going into my sophomore year of college. This means both A) I know a lot about history, and B) I'm damn good at pretending to know everything else. I'm seriously considering getting into historical reenacting, and have been starting to plan putting together a Wehrmacht uniform for the past couple weeks. Wehrmacht because imo a lot of people tend to forget that the average Wehrmacht soldier wasn't a hardcore Nazi, he was a college-aged kid whose major priority was getting back home in one piece. \n\nWhat else... well I've been playing the drums for about 7 years now and I'm pretty damn good at it if I do say so myself. Tried playing guitar for a while but I sucked at it so I stopped. While we're at hobbies I actually haven't been doing the arts for that long. Like a year and a half or so, if that. Before that I basically *never* drew stuff. So, uh, yeah, follow your dreams and stuff! \n\nFinally, just random stuff: My family homebrews beer and as a result I'm an absolute snob about the stuff, I own a pair of repro WWII-era combat boots I wear pretty much daily, I hold Australian citizenship courtesy of my mom who was born there, my favorite movie is Blade Runner, favorite series is The Pacific, favorite food is (at the moment) banh mi and favorite beer is Revolver Brewing Blood & Honey. \n\nSo yeah, that[.], uh... me. :P "}
