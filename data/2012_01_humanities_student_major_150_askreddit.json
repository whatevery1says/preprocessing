If I had to choose between a kid learning to appreciate Salinger and a kid knowing that spending his entire paycheck on a new spoiler for his car is a bad idea, I'd take the later hands down.\n\nSchools are not for life skills though. \n\nOur education system already teaches life skills. If a student comes into the system that can't dress themselves or isn't toilet-trained, they get sent to special ed classes until they are ready to join the larger classroom. Physical education in some districts includes hygiene classes. I don't think anybody would argue that we should teach algebra to a student that can't read or write or do basic math, but we're willing to teach physics to kids that have never heard of setting a budget and appreciation of the arts to kids that don't understand that you can get pregnant even if it[.] your first time.\n\nI completely agree that parents should be providing these skills, but they aren't. And I don't think that getting the skills to succeed as an independent adult should depend on how lucky you are to be born into a good family."}
