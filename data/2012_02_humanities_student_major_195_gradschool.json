I researched the schools I applied for and knew what I was getting myself into. I knew what kind of research I wanted to do before applying, who I wanted to work with, how long the program would last, what classes I'd have to take, etc. All that information is typically online, so it was fairly easy to find out. So, grad school was exactly what I wanted and expected: a lot of work that will earn me that coveted PhD so I can call myself Dr. Trillian42, hehe. \n\nSeriously, though, it[.] a lot of work. You have to be prepared for that. Your social life is limited and will consist of socializing in the moments before class with your fellow grad students and socializing at department gatherings. I'm in the social_sciences, so sort of related to the humanities. However, as long as you have a project you are passionate about and an adviser who is willing to work with and guide you, you'll be successful. \n\nOne last tip, when scheduling office hours (if you're a TA/grad student instructor), be sure to schedule them at the same time as your office mates (if you share an office with other grad students). This really helps in forming friendships and will give you someone to talk to when you have to be there and you aren't helping any students. Unless you don't get along with them, then that[.] a different story."}
