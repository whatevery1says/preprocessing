You really can't predict what would happen in 5+ years. What[.] hot when you're a junior in high school might be stagnant by the time you're graduating from college, and usually, you can't change majors in the middle of your junior year in college without throwing away your first two years.\n\n I find most of the people complaining have garbage liberal_arts degrees, in what parallel universe is it rational to think that a creative writing degree will hold any relevance to any kind of steady career?\n\nIn general, it[.] a fallacy to believe that your career will be exactly the same as your degree. For all the hype engineering degrees get, it[.] really only relevant if you have a career in engineering. If you are pushed out of engineering by choice or circumstance, your 4 years of college is basically a waste and you're SOL. english_major, for all the bashing they get on Reddit, are applicable to multiple fields because if nothing else, english_major are trained to not sound like complete retards on text, which is applicable in every single business that has a functional email server, and your job isn't relevant to your degree anyways."}
