What are you studying? I've flirted with a lot of different areas within the humanities and while you do occasionally get some obnoxious idiots spouting their political ideas (left or right) in class, *literally everyone hates them*. And it[.] not even because they disagree with them - I've talked to outspoken feminists who where relieved when a certain person didn't show up to the feminism class because even she couldn't stand her.\n\nTo be honest, I understand where your coming from, and maybe my experience is anecdotal, but I wouldn't worry too much about it. I remember last semester during a class about ecofeminist economics, being terrified to ask what ecofeminist approaches offered that other environmental approaches couldn't. I wasn't trying to be a dick about it, I just wanted to know. So I told them that during a group discussions with two people who where very into it, and asked my question and we spent the next forty minutes discussing it and while they didn't answer my question, that probably had more to do with it being 5pm in the afternoon and me phrasing it badly. Basically, as long as a question/opinion is appropriate (in both context and phrasing), in my experience it doesn't matter what it is. "}
