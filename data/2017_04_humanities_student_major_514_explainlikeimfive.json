Hell, i even went to a fine arts middle school that selects their students through art competitions and etc, and they still spent more money on sports than the arts. For every public US school, the English and history and music and art classes will have to fundraise for supplies and textbooks or use the same stuff for 10 or 15 years, while the gym and sports will have brand new equipment, new auditoriums and fields and stuff.\n\nIts ingrained into the culture sadly. At least up until todays generation of school kids, if you weren't athletic and on a team (especially as a male) you were a failure to many. Even to your parents for a lot of people. School administration and many teachers treated athletes like celebrities and were much more forgiving with any mistakes. It[.] been this American culture that all real men should be good at sports even as children and to be ashamed if you aren't. Academics and intelligence wasn't valued by many when I was in middle and high school. Although it definitely was in elementary school. \n\nAlso, for many Americans that can't afford a good college or can't get a good scholarship, being good at a sport greatly increases your chances of getting into a better college and getting a good scholarship.
