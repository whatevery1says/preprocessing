OP mentions double *or* triple science. So there[.] some flexibility here. You may like to consider what the popular options are - having a bunch of good friends in SS and JC is more important for your mental health than whether you're mugging one TYS or another. They all blur together, really. (but don't bet everything on your bestie[.] subject combo - people change a lot in their teens)\n\nOP didn't mention family wealth (or if you think you're scholarship-bound). But I will point out that overseas law/politics/history/etc. faculties tend to favour science students - it[.] much less popular in the West and it[.] much more universal. Many countries take a rote approach to humanities pedagogy, which undermines the quality of international students that run around with what *looks* like straight As - Singapore triple H + KI + Math can be murderously difficult but you don't actually get much out of it at the admissions office. For this plan, fill your extracurriculars with something appropriate (HMUN, filmsoc magazine, student journal article - best is something that involves writing essays). Almost all of the syllabus is irrelevant for humans anyway, you discard it all and start from scratch at an undergraduate level."}
