Maybe I only thought that I had read this article, but there was some sort of hidden part where it backed up its assertions that\n\n* [The Harper government is] a neo-conservative majority that espouses neo-liberal unfettered capitalism that enriches only, well, the already rich\n* The Harper government comprises hardline ideologues slinging insults and slogans from an outdated and discredited handbook used by George W. Bush in the U_S for eight long, war-filled years\n* the government is intent on imposing the same failed Republican ideologies on Canada\n* [Harper] managed to transform Canada from a highly respected beacon of democracy and peace on the world stage into an aggressive pariah that has made many people around the world ask, \"What has happened to Canada?\"\n* [Harper] embraced militarism and a new pugnacious foreign policy, disparaging dialogue and diplomacy\n* [Harper] is waging war on truth, statistics, science, access to information, tolerance, sharing, equality, enlightenment, the arts, social justice, the environment, gun safety, labor, civil rights, openness and transparency, and any kind of welfare (except that which he grants as tax breaks to his petro-friends and corporate buddies) [Many of these are clear references to specific policies of the Conservative government, but that doesn't excuse the author from the obligation to explain how Harper is waging war on truth, tolerance, sharing, equality, social justice, or my personal favourite, enlightenment]\n* The Harper government has cut or refused funding to aid groups that work with the world[.] most vulnerable people\n\nCan these positions be defended? Is there a sound argument based on actual policies or statements coming from this government that can be used to support these assertions? I don't know, because the article that I read didn't even try. It is merely a series of assertions about bad things that Harper did or wants to do without concrete examples backing them up. If the author didn't have room for that kind of detail in the space afforded to them, they shouldn't have tried to write an article with a thesis so meaninglessly vague as \"this government sucks.\" As it stands, this article is nothing more than a list of things the author wants to be true about Harper and the Conservatives in order to justify their hatred of them."}
