To start off, you can't go wrong with taking two math classes, one each term. Next, it depends if you are on more of the CS/math side or the Biology side of things. If you are more into the CS stuff, taking the first two CS courses would give you a good jump. Or if your more Bio focused, maybe take two science courses. If you don't know what to do, take one of each! (Intro to CS A term, a bio course B term) For the last class, you can start on your language humanities. This depends on what language you are doing. If you have advanced credit, or the placement test can give you credit for the first one or two, then you're going to need to find a substitute, as only the first course in the language is typically offered A term. You could take a social science or even GPS (But remember, GPS is a 2 term commitment). I wouldn't recommend taking 3 technical classes to start college off, especially if you are taking the first 2 CS courses. Lastly, take a gym class each term. Freshman year will be the easiest, and you want to get those out of the way while you have it light. They are 1/12 unit, but it is not an overload. "}
