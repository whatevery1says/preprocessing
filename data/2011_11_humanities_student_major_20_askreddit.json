Most of the posts you talk about come from these people who are poking fun at the mind-boggling stupidity of some people - not specifically because they're christian (which is why you don't see lolgod posts), but because they choose to believe the bible over anything that contradicts it, regardless of evidence (ie, evolution, young earth theory, etc). \n\nThe same kind of tone would be used for anyone who has read a lot of JRR Tolkien and believes that middle earth did exist and humanities evil drove the elves and dwarves away. The main difference between the two types of believers is that the majority of the US is not composed of middle-earthers, and no one has to swear on an original copy of The Similarion to get appointed to office.\n\nVery few of these style posts come from people who live in a predominantly non-religious country, because their schools teach science in a science class, and save religion for those that attend church.\n\nThe main point of r/atheism, however, is to provide support for people who are coming out in hostile situations - like the gentleman from pakistan who was expelled from university for being identified as a non-muslim, or the many teens who are children of strict religious parents. Those posts contain very little humour and are, by far, better representative of r/atheism than any stupid facebook picture or ragecomic."}
