At my private college non-students are not even allowed on campus outside of public areas like the library and sports/arts facilities. If you showed up as a random face on one of my classes I'd ask who you were and then ask you to leave as soon as I found out you weren't enrolled. (Of course, our students are paying $45K a year to sit in classes, so that[.] part of the issue.)\n\nThat said, most schools have a formal \"auditing\" system that basically does what you are suggesting: students register as auditors, attend all the classes, and simply don't do the assignments or receive any credit. An auditing transcript is often created though. I have auditors in my classes occasionally, but my school charges a hefty fee for auditing (about $500/course) so it[.] usually only employees or students who have extra time.\n\nWhen I taught at a huge public institution the rules were basically the same-- auditors had to pay a fee and register. That said, in a class of 450+ there[.] no way I'd ever know if a random stranger was registered for the course or not, so you'd be on pretty safe grounds just sitting in without registering, at least until I had students form groups for projects or outside-of-class work and everyone around you realized you weren't really a student.\n\nBottom line: ask at the school you are specifically considering. It'll probably be fine at some, at others you'll be chased off by campus security."}
