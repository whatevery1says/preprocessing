You have twelve week terms and the same holidays as undergrads though you might have deadlines for coursework in the holidays (you can post it in if you're not in Norwich). You do three modules a term, just like undergrads. The modules will usually be harder than undergrad (of course) but in some cases they are only a tiny bit more advanced and in others they are jaw-droppingly complicated. You'll still have summer exams for some of your modules.\n\nThe big difference is the dissertation, which you write over the summer (though you'll want to make a start in Easter to give yourself enough time). My word limit was 12,000 words, other people[.] courses were between 8,000 and 20,000. You get a supervisor (different schools do it very differently, I thought of a project idea and was assigned a supervisor, in other schools students apply to supervisors) and the_right to meet them several times and ask for advice on your work.\n\nThere are facilities just for postgrads provided by most faculties like the Arts and Humanities computer room and the Grad Bar in Union House. These make life a little better.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions or want to say what course you're planning on doing then I might be able to give you more detailed advice."}
