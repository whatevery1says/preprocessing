Without AP or IB credits, I doubt it would be possible. You are at Stanford to take classes, not to power through as quickly as possible. Or at least, that is what they will point out. They want people who are interested in utilizing their time at Stanford as much as possible to learn things they might not have studied otherwise. For this reason, you'll never be able to get out of a WAYS requirement. Those aren't necessarily just \"thinking/liberal_arts-like\" classes, they are just biased that way because most Stanford students do something technical, and might not take them otherwise. They are also, generally speaking, good classes taught by engaged professors.\n\nYou will probably be able to skip Math 41 and 42 if you have taken the equivalent to AP Calculus AB. If not, you can take another math class and apply to have it replace the requirement. CS 103 is also much more difficult than you think it will be. CS106A&B can be supplanted by CS106X. I doubt you'll be able to skip it; in addition to teaching about programming, it lays down the fundamentals of how you will be evaluated on your programming at Stanford. The 106AB and 107 classes make sure that you have a really great fundamental understanding of programming, I would not recommend skipping them."}
