D..* Those odds are going to get worse each year, possibly forever, as more and more permanent faculty are replaced by temps at public universities. Are you up for that gamble?\n\nBy contrast, you can teach either subject in a public high school with a BA in most state (MA/MAT in a few others) and there are still jobs available. You'd most likely have to get certified in social_studies, rather than history specifically, and would probably end up having to teach geography/econ/political science as well... at least that[.] what happened to all of my friends who went that route. Do English and you'll get to teach a mix of literature and composition courses.\n\nIn any case, \"job stability\" is excellent in both professions once you have tenure. The big difference is that there[.] almost no chance you'd actually *get* a job as a history or English professor even after spending ten years in graduate school (that[.] the average now for a humanities Ph. D.) whereas the vast majority of people who earn a teaching credential and seek out public school teaching jobs do in fact find them-- but a big chuck (close to half IIRC) quit within five years."}
