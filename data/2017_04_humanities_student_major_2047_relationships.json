You have identified a major difference between you and he, and that is you have drive and value your education more than him. It[.] an incompatibility, but only you can decide if it is a dealbreaker.\n\nI have brought this up with him but he is still the same.\n\nDon't ever date someone hoping they will change. It is safe to assume that he doesn't have as much drive or ambition as you. I don't think there[.] much you can do to convince him to change, since that change would have to come from within.\n\nOR if I should stay with him because maybe with time he will mature and get his act together?\n\nI would stay with him until it becomes an actual problem. You guys are still in school for what, two more years? Fortunately his lack of direction won't really be an issue for a while, and it is possible that he finds his calling in that time.\n\nThat said, if you're turned off by a major aspect of his personality, it might be time to move on."}
