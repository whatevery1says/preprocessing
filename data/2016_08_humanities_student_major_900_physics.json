(Throwaway to ease paranoia)\n\nThe academic year here is in quarters, with students taking classes in Fall-Winter-Spring and usually doing research (or internships, if you're CS/engineering) during the Summer. Junior/senior year it[.] not uncommon to do research for credit during the year.\n\nMost of freshman year is Core Classes that everyone at the school takes. Specialize more into your major (technically \"Option\") sophomore/junior year. Depending on your background coming in, you may pass out of some introductory frosh/smore classes. \n\nTypically people take ~5 classes each quarter (graduation requirement is ~4. 5/quarter, ~4 is the minimum to keep financial aid), with one of those being in Humanities/Social Science (HSS) and the rest technical. \n\nHere[.] the full plan, with the textbooks used where I know them. You can look up the course descriptions at http://catalog. caltech. edu/current/courses if you'd really like. (note: this is the \"standard\" plan. It[.] not uncommon to move some things around.)\n\n**Freshman**\n\nFall\n\n- Ph1a: Classical Mechanics (Mechanical Universe - Frautschi)\n- Ma1a: Proof-Based Calculus (Apostol vol 1)\n- Ch1a: General Chemistry (Oxtoby)\n- Elective (usually CS1, intro programming in python)\n- (HSS)\n\nWinter\n\n- Ph1b: Special Relativity + Electrostatics (Helliwell for SR (iirc), Purcell for EM)\n- Ma1b: Linear Algebra\n- Ch1b: Gen Chem + Intro Orgo\n- Elective (maybe Ch3: intro chemistry lab, or a CS class)\n- (HSS)\n\nSpring\n\n- Ph1c: Electromagnetism (Purcell)\n- Ma1c: Multivariable Calculus\n- Bi1: General Biology\n- Ge1/Ay1/ESE1/IST4: Intro Geology, Astronomy, Environmental Science, or B. S. (depending on preference)\n- (HSS)\n\n**Sophomore**\n\nFall\n\n- Ph12a: Waves (Crawford.....)\n- Ma2a: DiffEQ (Robinson)\n- 2x Elective (A common one here is Ph5: Electronic Circuit Lab [Horowitz&Hill] or Ma5a: Group Theory [Dummit&Foote])\n- (HSS)\n\nWinter\n\n- Ph12b: Quantum (Griffiths)\n- Ma3: Probability & Stats\n- ACM95a: Complex Analysis + ODE (Ablowitz)\n- Ph6: Physics Lab - Classical&Atomic physics experiments + data analysis\n- (HSS)\n\nSpring\n\n- Ph12c: StatMech (Kittel&Kroemer)\n- ACM95b: ODE+PDE\n- Ph7: Physics Lab - Particle&Nuclear physics experiments + data analysis\n- Elective\n- (HSS)\n\n**Junior**\n\nFall\n\n- Ph106a: Classical Mechanics (Hand&Finch / Goldstein / Landau)\n- Ph125a: Quantum (Shankar)\n- Ph127a: StatMech (Kardar vol. 1)\n- Elective\n- (HSS)\n\nWinter\n\n- Ph106b: Special Relativity + Chaos (1st half - Rindler / Hand&Finch); Electrostatics (2nd half - Griffiths / Jackson)\n- Ph125b: Quantum (Shankar)\n- 2x Elective\n- (HSS)\n\nSpring\n\n- Ph106c: Electromagnetism (Griffiths / Jackson)\n- Ph125c: Quantum (Shankar / Weinberg)\n- 2x Electives\n- (HSS)\n\n**Senior** (some people do senior thesis, which is one class each term)\n\nFall\n\n- Ph77a: Advanced Physics Lab (http://pmaweb. caltech. edu/~ph77/)\n- 3x Electives\n- (HSS)\n\nWinter\n\n- Ph77b: Advanced Physics Lab\n- 3x Electives\n- (HSS)\n\nSpring\n\n- 4x Electives\n- (HSS)\n\nAs you can see there[.] a decent amount of flexibility, especially junior+senior year (there[.] some restrictions on how these electives can be filled, but I won't go into the details). Really up to personal interest, but some common things are:\n\n- Research / supervised reading for credit\n- Physics: \n\n - more terms of StatMech (Ph127bc: Phase transitions, field theory, renormalization, gauge fields [Kardar vol 2 / Goldenfeld])\n - Ph205abc: Quantum Field Theory (Peskin&Schroeder / Srednicki)\n - Ph219abc: Quantum Computation (Preskill Lecture Notes / Kitaev & Shen)\n - Ph236ab: General Relativity (Misner Thorne Wheeler)\n - Ph 223ab:  Condensed Matter Theory\n - APh 109: Nanofabrication Lab\n - Ph 101: Order-of-Magnitude Physics\n - Ph 136/ Ph115: Fluid Mechanics\n\n- Math (either in the Ma or Ph department): Abstract algebra, real analysis, geometry & topology, probability theory, advanced topics/seminar (e. g. NCG, information theory, math-ph) \n- Computer Science: Programming methods (C++), functional programming (Haskell), Computing Systems/Architechture, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Computational Physics"}
