Majored in theatre & Spanish. Hung out (hang out) with artsy, nerdy types, and dirty hippies who smoke a lot of weed and frequent music festivals.\n\nMost of my friends are gun nuts, and several people I went to college with carry. Yesterday I attended a 2nd Amendment Picnic (ie: shoot guns all day, grill and drink beer all night) with a college buddy and our boss that we worked for on campus as work study.\n\nA whole bunch of my college friends were there on the GI Bill, and there[.] an active ROTC battalion on campus that taught me how to disassemble and reassemble m16s in class, and took us to the range to let us shoot them.\n\nMost of my professors are pretty liberal. Few of them have guns for any purpose other than hunting, but a whole bunch of them hunt. Hell, a bunch of them made attendance optional for the first day of deer season. Many of them understand my desire and right to carry, and several support it as a civil right, though they themselves don't own any.\n\nIt all depends on where you are. We maybe didn't advertise it to the world, but a lot of us gun owners migrated to each other, and it wasn't unheard of to discuss firearms in classes or to see people with magazines about guns, hunting, or shooting."}
