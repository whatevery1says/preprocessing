Nobody said to my face that my degree was a waste, but I've certainly gotten a lot of \"So, what are you going to do with that?\"  I'm currently taking a year off while applying to graduate school, with clear goals outside of academia if that doesn't work out.  The people who wind up working in retail long_term after getting a liberal_arts degree are the ones who didn't have a clear path for their career, didn't network or do internships and generally just knew that they \"really liked\" philosophy or 18th century european history but didn't know what they could do with their passion that would make them employable.\n\nNobody on this subreddit can tell you if you'd get a job or not and nobody can predict what the economy and job market will be up to in four years.  I'd think about what you'd consider a reasonable job.  Do you want to make a lot of money or would you be okay with making less if it means doing something you're passionate about?\n\nAlso, I would not recommend majoring in something just because you think it'll help you get a job after graduation.  I know many miserable business and engineering majors who have jobs but hate what they do."}
