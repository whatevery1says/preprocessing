As long as you accept that there isn't a definitive career path after you graduate, and you know the realities of the job market and you still want to major in English, then stick with it. Look - college isn't necessarily all about finding a job. It[.] about you and your own personal development too. Absolutely do not force yourself to major in something you don't want to do. \n\nPersonally, I majored in Political Science and was in the same boat as you. I took a year off before going back to school, but what I learned during that year is that opportunities were limited, and they were often low paying. BUT, if I had seriously pursued looking for a job instead of just trying to pass the year, I know I would've landed a decent job eventually and have new opportunities open up for me. For example - I got an offer to work as a receptionist at a small optical store for around $14/hr. Not amazing, but the owner was nice and offered me the opportunity to study under him to become an optician. \n\nThe reality of being a liberal_arts major is that you would have to start low and work your way up. You might have a tougher time trying to figure out exactly what types of job you want to do, but the opportunities are not closed to you. "}
