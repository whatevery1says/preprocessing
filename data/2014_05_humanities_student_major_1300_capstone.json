It[.] kind of boring, but requires no effort. It[.] also an SB credit should you need that. \n\nAny of the KIN courses are good if you want to get a little exercise and class credit together. Most of them are 1 credit hour, so you could choose two of those. From what I've heard, the Running course is not good if you're not in shape. \n\nMC 101 Intro to Mass Comm is really easy, mostly stuff you likely already know. Also an SB credit. \n\nWS 200, Intro to Women[.] Studies, is an easy course, and very thought provoking. Even if you don't agree with everything in it, it opens up discussion, makes you consider WHY you think a certain way, etc. I took it online last summer with Dr. McKnight and it was a good course. She definitely welcomed open dialogue and criticism via the Blackboard discussions. This is a Humanities credit as well. \n\nBeyond that, I'd say pick a topic you have some interest in and take the \"Intro to\" course. Few of these will ever require more than maybe a 3 page paper. Or if you're just really good at math, take a low level math course. \n\nIf you have questions about a specific course post that--people may be more able to answer that than provide suggestions from the full course list.
