The sheer volume of work along with balancing all of the various deadlines was a nightmare.  (My department as an undergraduate, because I was doing a double major of two languages, had agreed to let me write one thesis project rather than 2, on the condition that the thesis was longer than the usual requirement *and* I would take 4 more miscellaneous upper level courses among departmental offerings. It was a small liberal_arts college and I suspect that they preferred that I was enrolled in more courses.)\n\nIt certainly affected my grades; there was no way I could have performed as well as I might have with a smaller course load, due in part to other personal commitments I had at that time.    \n\nI can't speak for a PhD, but having completed an MA and working on another right now, I can say that my final semester as an undergrad was far less easy to manage than any semester I've experienced thus as a graduate student.  2 or 3 courses, even if individually bearing a fair amount of work, are simply more practical to organize than 5 or 6.  I wouldn't let your current situation discourage you.      "}
