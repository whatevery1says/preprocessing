What they describe as the problem with academic journals is real and has narrowed access dramatically. Basically, the 'Google' in that position used its power to do exactly what authors and librarians feared in this case. They took the monopoly and jacked up the price and now the only way people can afford to read digital copies of all of this scientific/humanities knowledge, that we subsidize usually through support of higher-education and research, is if they are students at a college that pays tens of thousands of dollars to the holders of bundled databases controlled by a few large companies. Individuals can buy access to individual articles for $30 at least. Scholars make $0 on their work, libraries scrape the bottom of their barrels to maintain access and all of the profits are on the 'Google' side.\n\nMy point is, there is not a good precedent for a tech-company NOT using its monopoly power to jack up prices with the consequence of locking people out. There is essentially just a powerful counterexample in scholarly publishing and the music industry. I 'feel' that Google would use its power differently and I can see how that kind of profit might be small-potatoes to them (so might now 'be evil') but that[.] a leap to take for the history that scholars and researchers and librarians have gone through."}
