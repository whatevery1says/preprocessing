I believe they did the name change just for clarity, as it is a Christian seminary. I think it[.] better at least. \n\nJohnson City is absolutely wonderful. Been here most of my life, and I moved away to other areas of the country for awhile... back now and couldn't be happier. \n\n4 distinct season. Tons to do outside. The mountains offer some of the best hiking East of the Rockies. Major fishing area. Mountain Biking. Kayaking. Rock climbing, etc. If you are from a big city, you'll notice we are lacking in the arts, but overall it is a great place to live. There is a burgeoning night life scene in Johnson City. The downtown area has changed dramatically in the last decade. Nicer places to spend a Friday night and have a beer if that[.] your thing. If you want an IMAX theater, major college football, and other big city stuff, Knoxville is 90 minutes away. Also, Asheville is just over the mountain is an outstanding place to visit on your Saturdays.\n\nTennessee is a red state, and I believe you will find that consistent in the Tri-Cities area. Predominately conservative. There are a lot more liberals in South Johnson City, surround the University... but that of course is a generalization. \n\nECS is great. I did some of my grad work there and I know folks love it. \n\nPM if you would like.\n\nGood luck! \n\n\n\n\n"}
