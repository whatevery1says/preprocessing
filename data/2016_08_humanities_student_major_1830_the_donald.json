Even then I got myself into a bad field (broadcast media). If I could go back and do it all over again, I'd 100% take a trade program. Maybe become an aircraft or marine mechanic. They can layoff, outsource. and temporary foreign worker all the jobs they want. When push comes to shove, you still need skilled domestic workers to install pipes, weld steel, and fix engines. It[.] hard_work, but it[.] good money and stabler than a lot of white collar jobs these days. I suppose it[.] getting too late for me to pick that up. That sort of stuff is for guys in their early 20s to start learning and doing apprenticeships. Not someone who[.] in their early 30s.  \n\nBut like you said, the school system actively discourages students from pursuing these roles.

Laugh is they're the ones with good jobs when a lot of the \"smart\" kids are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nUniversity level business and STEM degrees have their uses. As an arts major myself, I think we should really be de-funding arts programs, or raising the tuition rates significantly to help reduce the cost of in demand fields of study. Humanities and arts are certainly interesting subjects but have little value outside academia. "}
