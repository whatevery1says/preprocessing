The reason was because they wanted my SAT IIs to be related to my major, and I'd only taken subject tests in the humanities. \n\n* At both Penn and NYU I applied to their College of Arts & Sciences. \n\n* \"Why Penn?\" was the prompt, or something along those lines. I wrote about why I was interested in my intended major and my medical experiences in Nepal; I also wrote about some of their extracurricular opportunities I was interested in.\n\n* Yes, I was also accepted to NYU[.] Shanghai campus as my second choice. I did not put down Abu Dhabi as I had no interest in studying there.\n\n* UPenn was really pretty. I was only there for a few hours so I can't speak to it too well. Lots of traditional red brick \u2013 lots of open green spaces. UofT St. George is in the middle of downtown Toronto, huge mix of pretty and ugly buildings. I only saw NYU from the top of a bus on a hour of NYC during Columbia admit weekend. It[.] way downtown, 100% urban, complete lack of campus.  \n\n* NYU gave me nothing, Columbia[.] FA set my family[.] contribution down to less than $5K US plus a scholarship to waive my work-study contribution for my first two years.\n\n* I applied to all the Ivies (rejected all except Brown, deferred), and Stanford (rejected), Rice (rejected), USC (rejected), a bunch of the UCs (accepted all), UofT (accepted), McGill (accepted), UBC (accepted), Queen[.] (accepted)."}
