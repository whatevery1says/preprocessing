Almost all good universities have research programs that students can apply for and most professors encourage their students to apply to programs that interest them. \n\nYou ever wonder why so many students hate math and science?\n\nI don't find this true at all? I'm in science and the people who were in my major loved their major - that[.] why they majored in it. They want to do more of their major for the rest of their lives. It[.] much more common that someone in the humanities hating science and math and someone in science and math hating the humanities, but I've never seen people actually hating their major (unless they made a mistake choosing their major which is obviously an exception).\n\n It is because all they every know is failure and pain. Instead of allowing students to learn from failure, college is a marathon race to the finish where if you miss one hurdle you have to start over or quit.\n\nYou mention this as if it is a negative? You said college should educate you and make you prepared for the real world right? Well in the real world, there are arbitrary hurdles, there are big assignments due that can make or break your career, there are unbreakable deadlines. This is the real world!! Students who go through the process of university are able to easy transition into the world of professional work because they already have experience with the \"system\". This is a good thing. \n\nMany professors claim to want their students to succeed, but then, why punish failure so harshly? \n\nBecause students have the opportunity to fail during practice. Students have to practice and prepare on their own, fail when it doesn't matter, then go to office hours, practice some more and then succeed when it does matter. That[.] how it works in the real world. If you give a presentation in an office for your boss you have to practice, learn from your mistakes during practice, and then give a more polished version during the actual presentation. \n\nI've know brilliant people, people far smarter than me who have dropped out simply because they couldn't pass a single course completely unrelated to their major. \n\nThis is ridiculous though. Many universities offer the ability to make courses pass/fail. Or if that option isn't available the student could drop the course before it is considered a fail. Those students could also talk to their professor or academic advisers regarding other options. I don't see why a student should feel the need to drop out because of one unrelated course. Maybe your university didn't provide educate your students about the necessary programs to deal with such situations. "}
