If you go to Johns Hopkins premed program because it \"looks good\", then you might go on to develop anxiety/depression over the workload, cost, and distance from home that could have been avoided with another school choice.\n\nThe evidence I see personally is that for any given med school class, there is easily a mix of public schools and private liberal_arts represented by the student body. They went to schools where they developed into viable med school candidates, and then they went to the school where the training truly mattered (undergrad matters a little, but practically speaking, it doesn't mean jack come matriculation).\n\nLong story short, go where you see yourself being a good candidate. Find a school that lets you have a car on campus so you can volunteer on your own time, or go somewhere with a med school attached down the street so you can shadow easily. Or maybe go because they have a good arts program and you will never be able to study poetry writing for a very long time, so you do that and take the pre reqs too. There are a million reasons why you COULD go to a certain school, but going for the \"prestige\" to impress med schools is a fruitless effort. The MCAT neutralizes this fairly easily, so GPA and school choice are more fair when applying.\n\nBest of luck with your journey, start early and ask lots of questions!"}
