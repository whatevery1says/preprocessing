I don't think there[.] any evidence that some people \"just can't learn\" barring more obvious ones like a mental disability and this kind of attitude disproportionately affects minorities such as blacks and hispanics. I also think England and Germany have substantial problems with fast-tracking young children (who may not know what they are good at or what they want to do) into specific careers.\n\nMore education means that people are more adaptive. The coming generation is going to be one where a far majority of people are going to need to be able to use their brain. Machines are going to do the grunt work. I also think that, in general, a liberal_arts education is a benefit to every profession as it results in greater problem solving capability and greater creativity. Both of these things are things machines can't do very well and are something that presently make humans unique.\n\nOtherwise, you just end up with another rust belt or coal country where the jobs of the past went away and the people need to adapt to the present. And as mentioned, it[.] almost always the poor black kid who gets told he[.] \"not fit for higher education\" or the little girl who is told she[.] \"just not good at math\"."}
