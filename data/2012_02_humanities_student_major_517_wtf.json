It[.] why they nominate those that sell a lot, and are genrally liked by the majority of the public. Because it[.] what people overall care about. \n\nThis I do not deny. But the point of an awards show (or what I feel should be the purpose) - is not to award what people generally like, but to reward those that are pushing the boundaries of the industry and the arts. So we have a difference of opinion here on what awarding artists should be for. That[.] fine. \n\nThat said, I find it funny what you say, yet the Grammys tend to pick winners that are not what mainstream people like or what the general public enjoys. Just go take a look at the winners. The Grammys tend to alternate, but they often choose a winner like \"Robert Plant & Alison Krauss\" or \"Herbie Hancock\" that most people (and i say most people, referring to the average music consumer) wouldn't listen to. By your logic, something like Katy Perry has more worth, because that[.] what the majority of music listeners like, therefore care about. \n\nI'm not even here to argue with you on that. Rather, I'm just pointing out the Grammys try to be an award show that is serious about the arts. And this is shown by how they choose winners. So it[.] not really lining up with what you are saying, or what they are saying. Which is why I think it[.] an awful award show. "}
