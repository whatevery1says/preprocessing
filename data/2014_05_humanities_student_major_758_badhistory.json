It gives you a historical background to a thinker who has greatly influenced the social_sciences, the humanities, and science. Marx is absolutely essential to understanding so many fields of study, and to not have that background is to remove a large portion of the picture of what makes the modern world. That doesn't mean \"applied Communism\" isn't important, but to see the application it certainly helps to have a background in the theoretical framework. \n\nBoring or not, it[.] still important to read these texts. For example, The Origin of Species is probably one of the most brutally boring book I have ever had to read in my studies, but there is so much to learn from reading it, and not to mention it hones one[.] skills of reading dense texts and extracting what is important for it for a relevant task. I know from my own experience and that of my other fellow students at my university that reading full texts instead of excerpts before looking at the application of the theory has lead to a deeper understanding of the application. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing to start teaching students full texts, and not just give them bullet point tidbits about what one thinks. I know my friends who had to read Ulysses, The Illiad, etc in full in high school are better students and thinkers because of it. \n\n"}
