As a TA for college courses, I'd have to say that grading is the worst fucking thing in the world, and it takes for goddamn ever. 20 5-page papers takes eight to ten hours to grade. 40 handwritten short answer quizzes, with about 10 questions, can take anywhere from 2 hours to 6 and a half hours. If your Prof. is using scantrons for the finals, then he[.] got to wait for all of those folks, who are currently grading scantrons for the whole university, to give him the scantrons back so he can give you the grades. \n\nThink about it this way. Your prof has maybe three classes, with lets say a cap of forty students, and let[.] say that they all had only 10 short answer questions quizzes. At the top speed for all those quizzes its gonna take him a tthe fastest 6 hours, at the slowest, somehwere around 19 and half hours. Change that to 5 page papers, and your lookign at a minimum of 24 hours of work, tedious fucking work, objectively reading 200 pages of shitty student writing about the same god damn subjects using the same prompt. \n\nEven at your small liberal_arts college, I bet there is a higher standard for feedback for students etc. and that makes it much harder to grade. Slapping a grade on a final is never easy, especially if you are trying to stay objective after getting to know students. \n\nTL;DR: Grading is long, mind numbing, tedious, and arduous, and that is why it takes so god damned long.
