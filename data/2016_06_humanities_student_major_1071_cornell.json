For context, I'm a rising junior in Engineering, and am not an international student. \n\nOkay! \n\nWhen I was in the process of applying to college in high school, the first thing that I looked for in a university was a great undergraduate engineering program. As such, Cornell was on my list from the beginning. I was sure that I wanted to do engineering, but wasn't sure what exactly in engineering I was interested in (CS, materials science, biomedical engineering, and chemical engineering were my main interests at the time), so I wanted a university that had a lot of options for when I made up my mind. \n\nIn the end, I chose Cornell less for its academic prowess and more for the feeling that I got on my first tour. My dad went to Cornell Engineering for his undergrad, so I had been on campus several times before, but Cornell was the first place where I stepped on campus and felt like I could actually live here for four years. I love the huge campus, and I love the fact that Cornell still feels like a small community in spite of its size. I met and had lunch with students in engineering, and they seemed like people I'd want to spend time with. They didn't fit into the \"engineer\" stereotype, and were able to balance their work with their extracurricular interests. They were also able to take liberal_arts classes (I'm into languages and creative writing), which was something that seemed difficult to do at many of the other universities that I attended.\n\nSo far, I have not been disappointed. I'm a sophomore now, and I've throughly enjoyed my experience at Cornell. I'm a member of four or five clubs, I participate in my residence hall community, I've made friends with some really cool and interesting people, and I work in a research lab doing work that could have significant positive impacts on the medical community.\n\nIn terms of the student environment, engineering is extremely collaborative. I've made some of my closest friends through homework and group projects that I needed help on. The College of Engineering places a huge focus on collaboration and teamwork, so everyone is always happy to help if you're confused on something, or work on a problem set with you, or study for an exam. I've walked up to random people in Duffield Hall (the engineering social hub) who were working on homework for a class that I was taking, sat down, and asked them if they want to work on it together, and I've never been turned down.\n\nAlso, I've never been bored. Given that we aren't in a city like NYC, most events/activities occur on campus and are run by student organizations/the university/greek life. At any point in time, there are festivals and athletic events (hockey games are super fun) going on that are open to the public. If you like to go out a lot and party, you can totally do that. Greek life tends to facilitate that, and most of the fraternities are situated very close to campus, so you can go out whenever you want. There are also a few clubs in Collegetown. If you're interested in social outings, there are an infinite number of options for that, especially given that freshmen get a free bus pass. There are fun formal events at the Johnson Museum where everyone gets to dress up, and there[.] a restaurant/bar near campus that does salsa nights on Wednesdays that I've heard are awesome. We also have things like Slope Day, a giant music festival in the spring.\n\nI like the blend of technical and non-technical courses that I get to take in engineering as well. We're required to take 18 credits of liberal studies courses to graduate, which amounts to about six classes over five years. Most freshmen don't take liberal studies courses, so you end up taking one every semester from your third semester on. I came in with a lot of AP credit in the humanities, so I don't have to take all 18 credits (I came in with 12 of the 18 credits), but I'm planning on doing a creative writing minor and taking several French courses. Obviously, our curriculum focuses on the engineering courses, but it is also flexible enough to allow you to take classes outside of engineering .\n\nSpeaking more generally, food was an important part of my college search, and Cornell has some of the best food I've had in general. I'd recommend the 14 meals/week plan to start, because you may eat breakfast and dinner on North campus as a freshman, and eat something smaller on central campus for lunch. There are a ton of options for food, so you'll never be bored with it (escpecially if you eat on west campus).  Statler has the best food on campus IMO, and they have a student run restaurant that does fun themed dinners every week. The food there is amazing, and pretty cheap ($15-20 for an entree and appetizer/dessert). \n\nThe dorms are generally pretty nice. North campus has a lot more variance in quality, because the dorms have been build over the past few decades, but everyone I know was happy regardless of where they were. I lived in Dickson, the largest dorm on North, and I loved it. It is mostly singles, which was what I wanted, but it[.] really social. I made some of my closest friends through my hall. Court-Kay-Bauer and Mews are the nicest/newest, and have air conditioning. Donlon is the party dorm. \n\n\nI'm going to stop here, but feel free to ask any questions if you have them. "}
