Most of your friends come from the dorms anyway. If you're coming from a small boarding school, you'll be surprised by just how many people you come into contact with every day.\n\nI made the huge mistake of living off-campus my first year and missed out on a lot of friends. When I moved to the arts village my sophomore year, I made a ton of friends and they were all really cool people. I'm still friends with most of them even after I've graduated.\n\nIt[.] really hard not to make friends in college. Seriously, everybody else is in the same boat and doesn't really know anyone. You'll be exposed to all kinds of people.\n\nMy advice is to just be out there doing things. Don't just sit in your room. If your dorm is a hall style, just hang out in the hall talking to people. I was pretty socially awkward in the beginning and felt uncomfortable in all of these crowds, but it just turned out that I hadn't met the_right people.\n\nThe main reason people become such good friends with people in their major is because you can do your homework/study with them. If you have the same classes, you see these people all the time and get together to do work so you inevitably become friends."}
