Bad bout of depression, followed by an okay couple of months and then a worse bout of depression. Just recently decided to give it another go with a psychiatrist at my school health center, and miraculously found the_right combo of medications -- now I'm in the same situation practically speaking, but everything has changed for me in terms of my motivation, general sense of well being (I actually feel *good* for the first time in ages!), and especially my ability to eat, sleep, and be productive! Just writing to say stick with whatever forms of treatment you can find for yourself, even if it seems useless and frustrating at first. I think most PhDs go through severe depression and anxiety at some point, especially with the job market how it is. Sometimes it helps to find some supportive people and discuss your feelings (depression is still such a taboo to talk about...). In the meantime, just realize that you are not alone, there are others who have been in your situation and found ways to come out the other end of it, and that you can (and will!) feel better. Best to you, my friend!"}
