For example, before Google[.] algorithm was as sophisticated as it was today, you had to guess and manipulate the URL - which was kind of a precursor to intuitively understanding how programming works (you create an input via a codeword that represents something to run an operator which leads to a certain output) \n\nThose 40+ grew up without mainstream access to computers and had to manually learn how to use the computer properly, and at that time, there were lots of training schemes at their workplaces - so they know and understand what to do.\n\n\nBut my pre-teen brother (who grew up with iPads/iPhones/DS) and all his freinds just take it for granted at how simple and quickly everything comes - and the short attention span that comes with it (it[.] affecting me too) If it doesn't work, or there[.] an unexpected error that comes up, they get impatient and click on anything and everything instead of stopping to think, look at the problem and deal with it. Also, a lot more students these days are shying away from maths and the hard_sciences in favour for the arts, english, psychology etc"}
