It all depends on what you're looking for in a program and what you want to get out of the program, which obviously varies person to person. Some of these might discipline specific or skewed toward humanities a bit, but these were some red flags in my search:\n\n* A bad website, especially for the specific school/department for my field. It is 2016 and there is no reason for an internet-savvy millennial like me to not be able to find basic information like professors, their research interests, admissions reqs/procedures, or degree requirements. This is really subjective, but the times that I did look into programs with bad web sites, they were also the ones that were unresponsive to emails from prospective students, etc.\n* Degree requirements that don't match your goals. For example, teaching is important to my discipline and I have a strong interest in my discipline[.] pedagogy, so schools that didn't offer courses in pedagogy were off my list. \n* Faculty with mostly similar interests (exception\u2014if a school is a Big Name in a specific sub-field) or rather vague interests.\n* Lack of representation at major conferences in my field. If none of the faculty have presented at major conferences in a while then wtf??? HUGE red flag, and a really conspicuous one in my field.\n* Scarcity of funding. \n* Trend of \"horror stories\" from current/recent students. \n\nAgain, a lot of red flags will be personal, because finding the_right program is about 'fit' IMO."}
