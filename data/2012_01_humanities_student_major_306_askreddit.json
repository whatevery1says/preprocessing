This was the worst mistake I could've possibly made. Seriously. \n\n\nI studied my ass off and still managed to fail one of the classes I took my first semester because I took challenging sciences and calculus. I barely passed math and am on academic probation. \n\nI had a 4. 2 in high school, 34 on the ACT, never had to work for anything before in school. But I'm much better at creative processes and social_studies than math and science. I took a science major because I got scared of the whole 'no jobs' aspect. But then I realized how many jobs are out there that other people don't even realize liberal_arts degrees apply to. \n\nI love animals, so I'm now studying psychology. Because I don't want to be a psychologist. I want to be around animals, and with a psychology degree I could easily find work at zoos or aquariums. \n\nDon't let other people tell you what to major in. And don't think you have to major in something you aren't good at to get a job. \n\n\nKnow your strengths, find majors that fit those, and find what you enjoy from there. \n\nEDIT: was raging when i typed this. so I fixed some of the jumbly."}
