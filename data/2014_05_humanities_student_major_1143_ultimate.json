To say that most if not all of our travel and tournaments is payed for is just wrong. None of the travel is paid for except for the trip to nationals which is covered by the school, not alumni.\n\nThe school has a 20-23% acceptance rate. \n\nThe early adapter part is correct, the team was founded in 1982, under the name \"Frisbee Union of Carleton Knights.\" \n\nIt[.] also true that we're treated like D1 football players. The school of 2000 students puts MILLIONS of dollars into a group of 100(ish) students for personal trainers, locker rooms, etc. We get cushy majors and special treatment from professors. We actually just got a new turf field just for frisbee players with a sauna, weight room, 24/7 on call massage therapist. Wait a minute....\n\nBut honestly, the main reason is that we get a TON of support from the school. Not even monetarily, but professors, administration, other students, etc, not only like Ultimate and want us to do well, but ACTUALLY care. Frisbee is a huge part of the culture at Carleton, so any youth ultimate player who is interested in small liberal_arts schools and Ultimate is looking at Carleton. We get a lot of good youth players, as well as athletes who have never played before, instead of just athletes who have never played."}
