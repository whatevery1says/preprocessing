The evolution of language is reported and recorded in the dictionaries, from beginning up to present,\" he told BusinessWorld in an interview on April 3 at the KWF in San Miguel, Manila.\n\n In order to work on Introduksiyon sa Leksikograpiya sa Filipinas, Mr. Almario said he had to read the oldest dictionaries he could find in order to know how the Filipino language evolved. \"Words' meanings change over time. And it has become a habit that almost every morning, I open a dictionary randomly to learn something new about words.\"\n\n That is when he discovers the etymology of words. For instance, \"art\" is not \"sining\" as \"sining\" is an old Filipino word which means \"to think.\" He also said \"theater\" is not \"dula\" in Filipino because \"dula\" is a Cebuano word for the verb \"play.\" The inhabitants of the Philippines had no dramatic art forms until the Spanish colonizers introduced the komedya, the stylized dramatization of conflicts between Christians and Muslims.\n\n \"That is why lexicography is an important tool for people who are interested in our language. And that is what I'm trying to advocate [this]. We give all our energy in studying English. Filipinos now don't study our language because it[.] ours... That is the kind of attitude I don't want because when it continues, we won't be able to help to intellectualize our language and serious discourses,\" he said.\n\n Introduksiyon sa Leksikograpiya sa Filipinas, which was launched on March 21 at the KWF, is in line with his advocacy to preserve the country[.] intangible heritage, which is one of the advocacies pushed by the NCCA. The book is the most recent addition to the KWF Aklat ng Bayan series.\n\n Mr. Almario expects to release the 2nd edition of UP Diskyunaryong Filipino soon.\n\n[Source](http://www. bworldonline. com/content. php?section=Arts&Leisure&title=new-book-tackles-history-through-language&id=143648)"}
