Heaven forbid an artist actually produces work with meaning.\n\nWhy, why, why do anything. You want the honest response? \n\nI've got a few good ones. I'm not much of an artist, myself, but I love the arts and have tried to be attentive in the courses I've taken. I've worked as hard as I could to learn to extrapolate some kind of meaning from the abstracts of modern art, to read the embedded language of the classical masters, to understand the Gnostic mutterings of McCarthy and blah blah blah.\n\nThe most honest response is that *an artist who explains their work is boring*. If I cannot read something in to it, it may be aesthetically interesting, but that[.] it. It[.] fluff, it[.] rot, it[.] pop music or a Zack Snyder movie. Sure, it can look great, but does it *mean anything*? Looking great ceased to be sufficient the moment the camera was invented, and you can see this in the evolution of modern art.\n\nOkay, so, you paint the next great masterpiece, and you tell people what it means. If there[.] no other angles for interpretation:  we're done talking about it. Mystery[.] solved, it was Old Man Willard. Wrap it up, let[.] go watch *Survivor*.\n\nYou know what art is with its message explained? Propaganda. \n\nPropaganda, ideally, does not allow for the organic growth of a synthesis. Instead, it directs it. You abrogate the cultural dialectic and institute your own path forward.\n\nAnd frankly, you're repeating yourself at this point. "}
