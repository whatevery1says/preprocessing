They are *desirable places to live*\n2. If you want to live there you *will be leaving money on the table* in the deal \n\nCost of living comparison tools are apples-to-apples. They ignore tons of other real-life factors like access to culture and the arts, larger job market if your current position goes south, ease of travel to rest of the country, etc. The position in Raleigh is harder to fill, because fewer people want to live in Raleigh. So they are willing to pay a premium to get you to take the job. If you don't take the offer in NY for $80K, hundreds of other students are lined up to take it instead. If you don't take the offer in Raleigh, it[.] possible they have just one or two other students who *might* be interested. \n\nLook at it this way - if you made $80K in NYC and wanted to go work in Raleigh instead, would you take an offer for $41K? Not likely. But that[.] what the cost of living calculators say you should make for that move. But in reality, they wouldn't offer you that. You would probably get $60ish because they know you need some convincing to move away from such a desirable place to live."}
