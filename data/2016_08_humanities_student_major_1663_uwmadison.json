I'm finishing off my syllabus right now, and it looks like it[.] going to be about 20 pages of reading (mostly the CRC common read which is super good) and 1-2 pages of reflective writing each week. The majority of the grade though, it[.] going to be 75% in my class, is going to be participation based from class. It[.] very discussion based, and depending on what students I get this year, in the past I've tried to try and let the students do about 90% of the talking.\n\nIn my experience I think it[.] a great way to meet other students; offhand I'll say that I actually took it a bazillion year ago when I was a Freshmen, and still hang out with some of the students that I took it with. I will say that if \"liberal_arts nonsense\" isn't your thing, you probably won't enjoy the assignments very much. But I was very much in that mindset back in the day, and some of the readings in the class really expanded my views.\n\nBut just like Reading Rainbow, you don't have to take my word for it. My advice that I usually tell students that ask is to just give it a shot for the first day, if it[.] not your jam you can drop it then. We don't feel bad when students leave if it isn't a good fit. Plenty of students will be adding/dropping it throughout the start of the semester."}
