The US has a system of higher education that[.] been working for it, but not all countries have as much emphasis on higher education as the US does, and they are doing fine in their own ways.\n\nA canonical example of a different system of education is Germany, which still employs a long standing tradition of apprenticeships. Apprentices start when they are the age of freshman in the US, and they learn a certifiable trade. It works well for them.\n\nThe truth is that for the foreseeable future, the US is definitely going to have some manual labor jobs, and I'm not saying that in any negative sense. The US still has large industries, construction, hell even USPS. People in these industries don't need a college education in the sense people mean it to. In fact, if anything, the fact that we have such large underemployment of college grads now shows that blindly going to college simply because it has become the social norm might not be the most economical thing to do. Trade schools are seriously under appreciated. Going to trade school and learning to be a plumber gives higher expected earnings than getting a bachelors in non-employable majors (canonical example being the humanities_major...).\n\nI would agree wholeheartedly that anyone and everyone can always be more educated. That doesn't mean it is necessary for their careers or livelyhood.\n\n"}
