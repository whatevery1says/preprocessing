I am tired of reading and hearing about how kids are wasting their money getting liberal_arts degrees, racking up too much debt and working in low paying jobs either in their field or out of it.\n\nA liberal_arts degree is very valuable in crafting a better person.  Critical thinking, reading comprehension, strong writing skills, these are what a liberal_arts degree provides.  I love my skill set, and it is a result of getting a liberal_arts degree.\n\nIt took me years to figure out what truly makes me happy.  It is not a big paycheck, a flashy car, or bragging rights.  For me, it is making my community a better place, being able to have a great work/life balance, continuing to utilize the skills I have obtained from college every day, and being able to travel and spend time with the people in my life who are most important.  My choices and those of people similar to me are insulted on a daily basis, and it really is a shame.\n\nWe don't don't blame society for poor people, we blame the poor themselves.  We don't blame tuition costs for college, we blame the students who choose majors that don't lead to high paying jobs.  We don't challenge or ask why, we simply stand by the status quo.  That is why we need more liberal_arts degrees."}
