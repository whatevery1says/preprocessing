Even if you don't know of a specific major you want, you probably have some idea of what you like to study: Hard Science/ Engineering, Social Science, Humanities, Business, etc. A lot of the majors within these areas will have an overlap on their base level classes, so find the base classes that open the most doors for you and take those classes immediately. calculus and physics will be required for just about any STEM major, bio for pre-med. I would guess about half of all majors require some sort of statistics class. Unless your school is known to smash students' noses to the grindstone for each and every class, take as many door openers as you can. Once you start meeting people around your school, you can talk to them about majors you are interested in, then make your decision. This will be especially helpful when you are taking junior/ senior level classes in your chosen major in sophomore year and realize you hate it: you still have time to switch and graduate on time. And if you get lucky and find a major you love on the first shot, you have that much more time to do research, get internships, work with/ get to know professors, etc.\n\nThe worst thing you can do is spend your freshman year on bullshit classes. Again, unless you are going to MIT or something, and you have a modicum of maturity, you don't need classes to \"adjust to college.\" Leave 'the anthropology of the cheeseburger' or 'physics for poets' for senior year, when you actually know how to study and the classes will seem like cake, so you can focus on your actual, hard classes that you are taking for your major."}
