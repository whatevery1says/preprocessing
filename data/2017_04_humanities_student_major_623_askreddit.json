I always hated the whole, \"What was she wearing?\" type of questions. They harassed me, even though I wore sweats and was very heavy. And the fact that other kids took their side--from MY college--was baffling. These were not strangers in the bushes. I had to see them every day. And the college broke the law by having men in a dorm marketed as all female. Apparently they started bothering other people after me, but I had moved by then. \n\nIt[.] weird seeing my friends from college who were meh about my situation suddenly get so outraged with this stuff now; like, where was that anger when it happened in their own backyard? I had other members of the administration blame me as well. I guess I'm \"lucky\" it was only verbal harassment and dirty looks. There was a girl there once who got raped by a male RA. He got to stay and the girl had to transfer. It was only when the Yale scandal broke in 2011 that I was both sad and relieved that I wasn't alone in this. I had purposely gone to a small college that wasn't a typical big, liberal_arts college thinking that these things wouldn't happen. I was naive. When I was rejected from EIGHT student leadership positions over the course of my college career, it was not due to \"too many applicants.\" "}
