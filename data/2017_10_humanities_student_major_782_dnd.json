Meet Rajani Saaya, a soon-to-be Way of Shadow monk as soon as she hits that sweet sweet level 3. She[.] somewhere between neutral and chaotic good, I think, but in the story she actively opposes the local government, so she probably leans more toward chaotic. Her family is known as the Saaya Shadowdancers, a monastery of wood elves trained in the arts of espionage, subterfuge, and all that sneaky shit. The country where she[.] from is run by some hella racists and her family serves the leading governmental power, so she noped out of that and started spying on the officials and helping people that opposed them instead. Her family found out and there was major fallout, ending with Rajani taking a serious wound to her right leg at the hands of her brother and voluntarily tumbling down a plateau to get away. Refugees from said hella racist country found her as they were fleeing and took her with them, treating her as best they could with no healers, but in the end her leg had to be amputated. She now has a sick prosthetic and wears high heels like they're nothing, and runs a clothing store while quietly working to rebel against her home[.] government."}
