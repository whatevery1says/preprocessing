No doubt there are people out there right now with humanities degrees that you would consider \"useless\" who already have corporate jobs lined up right after graduation. \n\nNever expect your college degree to immediately qualify you for a job. That[.] the worst and most entitled position to have towards job searching. Getting an MBA in your position would be even worse, there'd be no point at your experience level. Just stacking degrees doesn't make you any more employable, in fact it makes you less. Don't worry about getting certifications right now either, those aren't going to help much.\n\nYou need to find a job and soon -- you should probably start aiming a little lower. Maybe look for lower-level administrative assistant positions at small- to medium-sized businesses who may be willing to take a new grad on. Your other option is to look for corporate internships for recent grads, almost all big corporations have them. The competition can be fierce, but its worth a shot. \n\nAnd as others have said, 20-30 applications is not a lot for a new grad. And don't automatically trust what some recruiter told you about your resume. Recruiters' opinions are a dime a dozen and they'll all tell you something different. \n\nFrom my own perspective, your degree is meaningless unless you have any real-world project experience to back it up. What kind of value could you add to a company? Have an answer to that question before you start putting yourself out there. Many employers would rather hire students who have a much broader liberal_arts education than someone who pigeonholed themselves into something like \"Management Information Systems.\" Sounds like an A. S. degree from community college to most people. \n\nIf you're expecting some $60k/yr gig right out of college, you are likely in for a rough awakening. "}
