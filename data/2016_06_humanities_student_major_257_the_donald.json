I have surrounded myself with Bernie Bros and Shills who seem to be oblivious to any of Trump[.] policies, his strength, and his leadership. They scream and shout \"He[.] a racist and a sexist!\" I had one friend say \"people who vote for him are deaf, dumb, and blind, and must have somehow stumbled into the voting booth and started pressing buttons.\" \n\nI have been silent for a long time due to fear of ostracization from my friends. But this video is the pinnacle of my anger. I finally posted this video, something pro-Trump on FaceBook for all the world (including Marx Cuckerberg) to see. Let[.] see how many look past the video just to ask if I'm a Trump supporter? Let[.] see how many try to justify the actions because Trump incites hatred? Let[.] see how many just unfriend me on the spot. \n\nI am so sick of liberal intolerance and selective blindness to their own faults. They love to call Trump supporters out for hatred, but ignore their own violent tendencies. Jesus said (and I'm paraphrasing here) \"before you tell me to take the speck out of my retina, take the fucking massive log out of your own damn eye and get your own damn life in order.\" It[.] about time these holier-than-thou leftist fascists did some self reflecting.
