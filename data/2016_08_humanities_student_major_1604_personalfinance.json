On the one hand, I am salaried but I *bill* hourly and I do have to bill x hours per year.  If my memory is to be trusted, it worked out to having to work one 9 hour day per work week back when I did the math so I'll leave it to a non-liberal_arts major to figure out the total.  Could I potentially get all necessary work done in less than 8 hours per day? Absolutely.  Am I going to meet my billing minimums if I don't find something else to do to bring me up to 8 hours a day?  NOPE!  That said, I think most lawyers tend to be rather fond of our jobs.  We greatly enjoy what we do so we don't so much mind the long days.  Part of what makes us willing to work so much is increased pay, but a good chunk is that we're largely type A workaholics that would probably be thinking about work even if we left early.  Plus, preparing for trial is going to result in 12 hour days whether I like it or not so even with the billables minimum, I get some wiggle room depending on settings and even some of the Big Law firms are backing off the 80 hour weeks so maybe things are looking up."}
