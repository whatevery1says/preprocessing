But in the big picture, the knowledge is all related. Not one being better than the other. What[.] an engineer without his concept/technical artist to help him visualize the work? What is the point of all that work in creating a television without entertaining shows to watch? It works in reverse too. How can an animator animate without understanding the laws of physics? How can you draw from life without understanding anatomy and biology? How can that concept go from being a concept to finish product without the engineer?\n\nThe arts are sort of like applied sciences. While art class in anything from a public high school and lower in the US should be renamed to coloring time. The actual subject isn't something to be disregarded. I have met so many art students who finally realized the importance of algebra when they began work with 3D, more so than any students in lower division chemistry classes. I've met more fine arts students who could apply the knowledge of the biology of our eye works and how light bounce off objects than most freshmen and sophomores in college. \n\nThe sciences inform the arts. The arts is vessel for the sciences. "}
