And it[.] not just on reddit, I know a lot of students who shit on liberal_arts majors as well.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of people I've talked to don't have a plan, and just went for it because it looks interesting. (I swear, asking 17-18 year olds what they want to do for the rest of their lives, and not letting them change their majors at some colleges, is a really stupid idea. The UCs are terrible for major changes, for one, due to funding issues.)\n\nI know someone who switched from psych to anthro because it[.] easier and didn't involve calculus, and she has no idea what she'll do after college/isn't really thinking about it. My aunt did psych in undergrad (grades weren't enough for grad school), and never got a decent paying job/one in the field. I don't really see that amongst my engineering peers - either you fail classes and change your major/drop out (business is a common one here), or you make it out alive, have some idea what you want to do, and get a job fairly quickly. It[.] probably partly the job market, but it might be because it[.] a more difficult major and you have to be serious to get through it - i. e. engineering students tend to have worse social lives/less free time than most (and people often take 5 years for that one)."}
