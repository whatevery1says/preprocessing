I discovered my interest in programming last semester and have since decided to propose my own major (computer science + art/photography). I went to a computer science conference with classmates and ended up at the career fair where I handed out resumes just for the hell of it. I am currently in (the 2nd month) my 3rd programming class. As it turned out, I somehow ended up with an interview and (unexpectedly) immediately after, a technical interview. I am currently learning java, haven't looked at javascript in over a year and  got so overwhelmed and intimidated (not to mention I am TERRIBLE at writing code on paper) I hesitated on a fizzbuzz question. She ended the interview with saying, \"You have a lot of photography experience, have you considered looking for an internship with that?\" OHHHBURN. \n\nI have no idea how to help you since I can't really speak from experience but I know that from now on, I am going full force, practicing with writing code on paper, practicing solving problems with various languages and going to someday prove to that woman there is a reason that I deserve to be part of this field.\n\nsorry for the rant. you hit a nerve.
