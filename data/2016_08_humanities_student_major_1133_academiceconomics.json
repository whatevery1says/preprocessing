I hope I'm helping in some way instead of just ranting at air. I've been a mentor to far too many kids in STEM+ (including economics) related fields that have this exact mentality, and it[.] always a struggle to correct.\n\nFor some reason, after recognising that no one on the world stage appears to be solely using science and empiricism to tackle complex issues of morality and governance, the most common conclusion drawn is that everyone is an idiot for not doing so, not that there must be a reason why everyone is not doing so.\n\nThe level of derision I often feel from my colleagues (I work in financial economics now, mostly surrounded by STEM PhDs) toward philosophy and the humanities as a whole is palpable, and I find it extremely sad that Western education now seems to be piling on STEM as the answer to absolutely everything, creating a rift even at liberal_arts schools that are supposed to grant a comprehensive education across a broad range of subjects.\n\nIt doesn't help that money seems to have all flowed into STEM fields, leaving behind little but Starbucks cashier jokes for the humanities_major. Speaking melodramatically, I think this over-reliance on science and empiricism to solve life[.] problems will potentially kill us all -- as it already almost did in the 20th century. And I say this as a STEM major (Math/CS)."}
