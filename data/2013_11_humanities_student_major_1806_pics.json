My friends and I spread the idea to fold a thousand paper cranes for luck, but also to keep everyone from falling into the anxiety of a loved teacher in a coma. \n\nAt first only a dozen or so were making the cranes, and we got to just above 700 in a week when he died. More students joined in in the periods dedicated to grief counseling and crane making. Many students wrote blessings, memories, song lyrics, quotes, and even drew pics on the blank sides of the origami paper before folding them into cranes. In the end I think we made more than 2,000.\n\nThe cranes were strung on different lengths of string, and then arranged by the math and the arts classes into a hanging memorial that hangs to this day above the central stair case.  It[.] absolutely beautiful, and it helped a lot of students find closure over the death of a teacher who got us so engaged in class and made History wonderful to learn.\n\nI would not be surprised if each crane that OP[.] dad made had a wish, a blessing, a memory, or some other written statement of parental love written on the blank side of the crane.
