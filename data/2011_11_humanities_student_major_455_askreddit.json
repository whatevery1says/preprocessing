If you think of education as just a step towards getting a high-paying job, then it obviously doesn't make sense to be a liberal_arts major. If you think of education as an opportunity to become a well-rounded individual who knows about lots of things, learning for the simple joy of learning, as opposed to being able to program a computer but knowing nothing about how to analyze a masterpiece by Cezanne and understand how his handling of space led to Cubism, or deconstruct a Yeats poem, or appreciate the camera angles in a Kurosawa film, or to understand why a hallucinating Chinese peasant who thought he was Jesus[.] brother led to the Boxer Rebellion, or to be able to spot the references to Baudrillard in the Matrix and know why it[.] important (neo has a copy of \"simulacra and simulation\" in his room when trinity comes to find him), or to be able to understand why Inuit culture condones infanticide or to know how Buddhism spread throughout the eastern world and how Buddhist meditation, tea ceremony, and flower arranging was used to \"tame\" the Ronin (masterless Samurai) after Hideyoshi redistributed the lands of the Daimyo and the Samurai had no one to fight for, or why the Renaissance was really just the rediscovery of Greek sculpture combined with a new humanism and an understanding of perspective, to know why color photography wasn't taken seriously as an art form until William Eggleston and Stephen Shore made it respectable in the 1970s, or to know how the Stanley Milgram experiments proved that most people will torture other humans if told to do so by an authority figure, or how the \u00a1Kung hunters have rituals that prevent arrogance in the tribe by requiring that the man who made a kill must come home empty handed as though he failed. \n\nNone of these things will help you to get a job, but the world would be a much poorer place without this type of learning. I took nine years to get through undergrad because I took so many classes outside of my major. I just want to know, and college is the place and time to learn this."}
