They're about as useful as studying underwater basket weaving and they don't do much to impress employers. \n\nDegrees in stem or business will pay the bills. \n\nIf you want to get into trading: get a real job and stash away some money, while you're stashing away money practice trading with a paper account, you can read books on technical analysis and all of that stuff, but I won't guarantee it will help, learn from your mistakes, set rules for yourself and follow them, learn to detach yourself from your money, stay rational. Once you've built up a nice bit of money that you can afford to lose, open up a margin account and start trading. You'll probably lose some money at first, because playing with real money is never the same as playing with a paper account, but stick with it, stick to your rules and remember a small gain is always better than any loss but a small loss is always better than a greater loss.\n\nNothing you learn as part of your college curriculum will help you become a day trader, however a business/finance degree can help get you a job in the industry and perhaps allow you the opportunity to work as an institutional trader, fund manager, advisor, or some other sweet job that allows you work in the market.\n\nHope that helps."}
