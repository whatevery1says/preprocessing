It may vary from town to town, but all of the places I've lived it[.] been allowed. Where I've been, it[.] open to the public; they had to let you in. You don't sit on the board or anything, but you can usually stand or sit in the back. Usually they'll have a few minutes planned where they open the floor for public concerns/questions. \n\nI didn't even realize that a lot of people might not know you could attend; I don't think that[.] a dumb question at all. I knew because our high school teachers were always trying to get us to go to protest things like budget cuts for the arts and what not. But if you weren't in the classroom hearing that, I suppose you'd never know! \n\nAs far as making a difference, the public doesn't really have a say in the week to week decisions, but you can see who[.] really there for the students and who[.] there for the money, and use that to vote intelligently. If more people attended, there'd probably be a lot more pressure in the moment to make honest decisions too.\n\nOh and edit: I feel bad in my original comment, I wasn't yelling at you OP, just yelling into the Reddit abyss. I get riled up about public school funds getting mishandled, it was a really big issue with my old school. You made a really excellent point and I agree with you, with the amount of money we spend we should be able to produce better results :)  "}
