Arts/humanities subjects were an afterthought and there weren't many options to take say 3 arts/humans subjects and less science subjects. The more \"full science\" subjects you took, the better you were considered (i. e. you were in the best classes if you took triple sciences). \n\nThe net effect of the above is that it made me feel really stupid in secondary school because I just did not do well in science and maths subjects even though I somehow made it into a triple science class. It was only in JC and uni that I realised it wasn't that I was stupid, it was just that I was not suited for those subjects. I enjoyed studying a lot more in JC and uni because I was studying things that I was better suited for and enjoyed. And I don't think I'm the only one who felt that way.\n\nIt[.] been some time since I was in secondary school and I've not kept up to date on whether there have been changes, but I hope there have been improvements on this front i. e. O levels being less heavily weighted towards the science subjects.\n\ntldr; the Singapore education system should be less heavily focused on science subjects - give students the options to pursue what they like without penalising them for that choice.\t"}
