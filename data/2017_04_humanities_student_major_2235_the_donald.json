I have a humanities degree. It doesn't make me more money, but it isn't supposed to. The problem is people confusing liberal_arts degrees with technical degrees. Liberal arts are for people to become those classy ass smarty pants types you read about in books like *Brideshead Revisited*, which you wouldn't read unless you took a \"useless\" class...\n\nLike I get the spirit of the post here: people are sick of the fluffy bullshit colleges have in the curriculum, but that doesn't mean there[.] a problem with liberal_arts. There[.] a problem with government funded bullshit colleges pushing leftist agendas. Don't shit on the liberal_arts because the people running the show have fucked it all up. I was lucky enough to go to a conservative, private liberal_arts college. It was wonderful. I shudder to think what type of idiot I would still be without the logic, ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology classes required for my major (which wasn't even philosophy). Not that you need these classes to not be an idiot, but damn, they sure did help. \n\nThat[.] what we need. *Better* liberal_arts colleges for people who understand what the liberal_arts are for, and tech schools for people who just want to learn skills to do a job. Pretty simple. I love this sub but sometimes I think folks hear \"liberal\" included in the description of shit and go nuts for no reason."}
