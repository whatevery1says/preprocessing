I see you as someone with a superiority complex who feels the need to attack other people for their decisions in life. From what I've seen, you actually don't know much about performing arts majors, and I wouldn't be surprised if you'd never even spoken to one. \n\nWhat you need to understand is that the people in visual and performing arts majors know exactly what they're getting themselves into. It requires a solid amount of planning, and a ton of dedication, though many find that hard to believe. The work that people put into the arts is astounding, and that work absolutely shows. \n\nAny sane person in these majors understands that, no, they're probably not going to be instantly successful; yes, they may have to end up working at a starbucks or somewhere similar for a while; and yes, they may never end up where they were hoping to. But the fact of the matter is they're passionate enough about what they're doing to deal with the low salaries, and the not-so-high job security, because in the end they're doing what they love.\n\nSo, if you really want to recognize some of your flaws, recognize the fact that the way you speak to people is very insulting, and condescending, and you do, in fact, seem very full of yourself. \n\n(On an unrelated note, starbucks managers actually make pretty good money, considering where they're at.)"}
