(honestly tho I haven't had room in my budget to get a TV so that[.] on me mostly)\n* What about FINDING a job? Making a resume? You gonna have to do that shit someday.\n* I can't even begin to imagine doing taxes on a phone.\n* I really don't know a single college student without at least a laptop\n\nYou guys are going to be so, so dreadfully underprepared for post-secondary education, most workforces.... Trust me, it isn't outdated. Don't get fucked over. Start building basic computer literacy now.\n\nEdit: Thinking about the guy some of you guys downvoted, like, srsly if they are chill with life and work, good for them, life can vary in funny and weird ways. I'm more concerned about kids growing up who might end up needing these skills for their career/life. There is a reason why, even though I am an art student, I was taught science and maths in highschool. I'm not going around saying science and maths are outdated hahah."}
