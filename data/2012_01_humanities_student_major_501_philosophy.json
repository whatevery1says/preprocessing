I've had five different jobs since graduating (some better than others), but all of them were based more on my computer skills. I'm currently back in school pursuing a full degree in computer science.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love philosophy and I don't regret my degree one bit. I'd like to pursue a master[.] or PhD someday. Even so, this is not an economy in which to go putting yourself into debt for a liberal_arts degree, unless you have a good sturdy plan B. Banking on a BA in something-or-other might have been safe in another time, but right now that[.] a good way to get those same flourishing minds that want to learn philosophy stuck in soul-destroying monkey jobs like customer service or debt collection for years to come.\n\nIf you can be happy in that kind of work, go for it, a degree will at least get you that, and it[.] enough to live on if you're frugal, healthy and childless. If you want something better, get a second degree, or stick with teaching / law school. Even my CS minor never scored me anything better than ISP tech support for 13 an hour.\n\nHonestly, scaring off the students that are learning philosophy because they think it[.] going to get them a paycheck is better for them, and better for philosophy."}
