Why not just have a single college cross boundaries between areas of study?\n\nThe theory and history behind it is that different areas of study allow students to focus in different majors, but simply satisfying the requirements for a major isn't sufficient to produce a well-rounded student. Besides focusing in a particular area of study, the student must satisfy a certain set of requirements outside that major field of study as well, often referred to as \"distribution requirements\".\n\nSo now you can see why these areas have been traditionally split up. Students that are focusing on music probably need a very different set of distribution requirements to be well-rounded than a physics student. This is why, typically, within a university a student will actually be in one of the colleges within that university, and have to satisfy the requirements for a degree (including distribution requirements) that are set by the college\u2013not the university as a whole.\n\n[source: Having briefly pursued two degrees in two different colleges within the same university, I transferred between colleges within my university and I know all about the headache of having to satisfy two disparate sets of distribution requirements in two different colleges.]"}
