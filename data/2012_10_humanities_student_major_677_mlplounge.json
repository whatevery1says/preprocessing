It[.] hard to really understand the prerequisites for a class like the Meme one.  We really don't know what they're expecting to teach, so it was probably incorrect for me to make that assumption.\n\nI think it would be awesome to take a Photoshop class or a pure MATLAB class or even something like web development or network certifications.  I've even taken a short cooking class (outside college).  Those are the kinds of things that you're supposed to do in college as part of a well-rounded education.  A meme-based class on the other hand, is in the \"underwater basket weaving\" catagory.  Might be cool to know, but I wouldn't PAY to take the class at a formal college.  A class on \"The Internet[.] Impact on Society\" or something would be different, but memes?  It[.] like having a college class on just knock-knock jokes.\n\nAnd this is the part where us business and engineering students usually just get in a circle and laugh at the Liberal Arts students like rich English aristocrats after all those hours of actually difficult classes.\n\nMy wife knows a girl who just graduated from college with a degree in \"Women[.] Studies\".  She took 4 years to graduate, and now has been looking for a job for a year.  She is really STUNNED that she can't find anything in her field.  Always makes me wonder what people expected to find when they graduate.  Did they even consider where they were going to work?  "}
