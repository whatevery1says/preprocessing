I'm assuming that wasn't your intention, but just an FYI for the future.\n\nSecond, I definitely agree that those are the two basic stances people take regarding education. I see the value in a general education, but I'd argue in this context, it[.] the wrong time to push that viewpoint.\n\nThe study cited by the OP is in regards to 15 year old students. Here in the US at least, barring rare exceptions, 15 year olds are still in high school. I'd argue that high school is not the_right time to push a general, liberal_arts education. There[.] only four years to properly educate students in language and math literacy in addition to preparing them for life outside of school - for me, that[.] a tall order already without pushing extraneous course requirements. \n\nThe liberal_arts approach I feel is much better suited for college, as it[.] done on a volunteer basis. Compared to high school, the students who are in college are there generally because they want to learn. In my opinion, a broader educational approach is much more suited for this point in a student[.] life, which is currently reflected in the degree curriculum for many universities with general and technical electives.
