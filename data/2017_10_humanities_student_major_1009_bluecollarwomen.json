I was in college and always jumping majors (from electrical engineering to humanities) because nothing really felt right or like I'd be happy. One day I just dropped out and decided to become an electrician. I enrolled in tech school and set out hunting for jobs. Luckily, I found a really good job that treats its workers well even though It[.] not part of the union.\nAs for your worries, I'm like 220 pounds and, though i'm decently strong and healthy as a horse, didn't really ever work out and I'm a soft squishy girl. the physical labor hasn't bothered me so far since the lifting is mostly light and I can balance heavy stuff on my hips. And the men I work with are patient when I struggle with stuff because everyone is pretty useless and clumsy starting out. \nNow, I've only been in this job for two months but I really really like it. I've been treated better in this field than any I've been in previously. The first 4 weeks I thought I was gonna die cuz my feet hurt, but now I feel just fine even after 8 or 10 hours (sometimes a little stiff but nothing a good bath can't fix.)\nI think you should try it out! If you don't end up liking it, at least you can live knowing you tried it :)"}
