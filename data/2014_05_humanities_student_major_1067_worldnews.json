Boomers got ahead getting liberal_arts degrees back when businesses were willing to hire a philosophy major and then groom them into the perfect employee with a 30 year future at the company.  \n\nThat doesn't exist anymore, you are ready to start on day one, and if you are smart, you will leave in 2 years for a better offer at the competition, because business stopped doing raises for performance because that cuts into the earning per share in the stock returns.  \n\nI think we are rapidly approaching the point where the idea of a \"job\" itsself is going to collapse and disappear.   No more will you be hired by the hour (or the year) in a long_term to permanent agreement.  \n\nInstead everybody will be temporary contractors jumping jobs and companies as a kind of pool of for-sale talent.   Which... already has it issues since Microsoft, Google, and Apple among others have already started blacklists and formal \"Do not hire\" collusion agreements to drive the price of contract labor down.   While they are being investigated, it remains to be seen if they are busted for it though.   Punishment for collusion and corruption of the markets doesn't seem to be handed out anymore.   \n\nSeem as of late the government at every level is just another good ol' boy in the corruption ring.
