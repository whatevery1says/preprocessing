US News is utter nonsense, is heavily biased towards small private schools with a focus on undergraduate prestige, and can easily be [cheated](http://thechoice. blogs. nytimes. com/2009/06/03/clemson/) by unscrupulous universities. If you want to compare small liberal_arts colleges like Middlebury and Swathmore, it[.] fine, but for a national STEM heavy research university, use the Shanghai Rankings or Top American Research Universities instead.\n\n2. You are pointing out the fact that the ACC has many fine institutions, which we all collectively acknowledged, but failed to mention how playing sports against them will benefit Louisville academically. Even for a school like Louisville with a huge and successful athletic program, the athletic profits are a drop in the bucket compared to the academic budget, and that[.] assuming they don't keep it all in the athletic department anyway.\n\n3. Sadly, the ACCIAC is nonsense. It is in no way comparable to the B1G[.] CIC. The CIC saves its members tens of millions of dollars per year and allows members to share facilities and even cooperate on major grants. The ACCIAC is nothing more than a few research symposiums and conferences, and a few travel grants. It is just a PR stunt to make the ACC look like an academic organization. The SEC has a similar organization. It would be great if the ACCIAC was more like the CIC, but alas it is mostly for show."}
