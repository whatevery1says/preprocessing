I did a Classics BA so I'm familiar with the requirements (unless they have changed them in the past few years which is entirely possible.) Classics only had two capstone classes that you take your final year but it was one per semester so you had to build your schedule around them. I don't know what CS requires but I imagine there[.] probably a senior project or something that could possibly conflict in your last year. Of course, CS is bigger so it may offer more of those classes. \n\nThe main problem is if you double major in Classics and Comp Sci, you're probably going to get a BA and a BS. I don't know what the policies are for counting your required classes in each degree.  I know BS degrees generally require more science classes and BA degrees require more humanities classes so you could end up in a situation where you instead of needing 4 hours of science and 6 hours of English for a BA and 6 hours of science and 4 hours of English for a BS, you need 6 and 6 which means an extra class or two. The easiest thing to do is to talk to your advisers in both departments and see what they say. The odds are really good that you are not the first student to want to do this in CS and they probably even have a worksheet that lays out what is required for each degree and will help you plan your next 4 to 5 years.
