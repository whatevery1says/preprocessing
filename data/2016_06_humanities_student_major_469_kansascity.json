Not saying that[.] a good situation for profs or the university system, but community colleges could easily be turned into existing 4-year programs at a much lower cost.\n\nMaybe you'd have a situation in which fewer universities have niche programs, like you have a super-group of latin scholars at one U ere everyone interested in that now goes, as opposed to having a few latin scholars at every U.  Maybe one of your state schools becomes the \"teaching college\" while another one focuses on sciences, etc.  There[.] certainly a lot of benefit from having so many programs at the same school academically, however it seems like for most students in common degress, they end up subsidizing that benefit for a relatively few number of cross-program students."}
