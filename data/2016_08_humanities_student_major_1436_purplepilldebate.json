Many still get a college degree after their training or on the side with online classes or programs designed for employed people while building their career but they are all capable adults.\n\n A lot of people my age simply do not have the judgement to make good decisions and the self discipline to do it. I feel confident making the generalization that virtually no one my age is a competent parent.\n\nThat[.] your social cycle most likely. College, especially in the US, delays maturity because you're not forced to adult. (Hell you call it \"going to school\" and sleep in dorms) The fact that so many young people are not mature enough is not caused by age - it[.] because society enables it. \n\n\nAt the same time there are young people who do work and are mature, they just don't hang out with college kids because they are adults and college kids are not. For them, having a  baby at 23 or 25 is very much a conscious and responsible decision (maybe after getting their degree while the other partner starts building a career or while empoyed). It largely depends on the individual and couple. At the same time others won't ever be mature or stable enough (looking at the 30 year old humanities major who changed majors 3 times)\n\n\n\nEdit: Just want to point out that having children later in life because it is right for you isn't bad or wrong either. My mom had me at 31 and my sisters (twins) at 40. She got to establish her career in biology and is a great mother. At the same time she didn't have the physical strength and vitality of her 30 year old self when she was 40 so additionally to having twins being hard, she also felt the first jabs of age and couldn't run around as much with the kids as she could with me. She also had fertility treatment and my sisters were born premature (that[.] common in twins though). It all has its pros and cons and heavily depends on your personal situation and preferences - saying, everyone should have kids young or older will inevitibly be bad advice for a number of people."}
