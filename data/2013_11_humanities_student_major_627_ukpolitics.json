My area is a little strange in that it has middle (years 6-8) and secondary (years 9-11) school, but all of these were split into sets for maths, english, humanities and sciences. I think that[.] standard practice for the vast majority of comprehensives these days, in that I've never heard of a school not doing it. Humanities varied. Sixth form was not banded at all.\n\nThis certainly contributed to the quality of my schooling, and I think being in sets does bring a focus that is required for higher and lower achievers, but I was in a second set as late as year 9 for history and now i'm doing a history degree at a decidedly decent uni - its not Oxbridge but its good. So I don't think banding is everything, and as I said, sixth form, when we had to do what we needed for uni, we weren't banded, and that[.] frankly when I did my best work.\n\nSo banding is good but isn't everything in my opinion, and splitting everyone up - taking some people off to grammar school - would mean things like that, where I got better at humanities over time, would have been completely missed and I would have been sent to a technical college or something when I could be doing academic work.\n\nI just find the idea of grammars very draconian and inflexible. There are problems with the current school system but they need to be solved by investment and new ideas, not division and decentralisation."}
