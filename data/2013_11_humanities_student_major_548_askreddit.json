Just that one word\n\n* South Park is a good source for information about any issue that matters\n\n* I can take whatever a comedian says out of context and get to the top of a thread\n\n* Women should constantly have sex and should also be shamed for having sex\n\n* Homosexuality can be used as insult but homophobia isn't really an issue any more\n\n* Trans people aren't people\n\n* Sexuality and gender is strictly defined by genetics\n\n\n* I should be perfectly complacent with the above because not every single redditor acts like this; never mind the fact that comments like these are always highly voted and even given reddit gold."}
