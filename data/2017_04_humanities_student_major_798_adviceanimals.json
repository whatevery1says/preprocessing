Let me explain.\n\nI come to you one day, and I say \"I tried to fix my computer today. I accidentally fried the motherboard because some static electricity went through it.\"\n\nSuddenly, everyone around me says \"Well, you fucking dumb shitbag, MAYBE you shouldn't have put a lightning rod on it! EVERYONE KNOWS STATIC ELECTRICITY IS DANGEROUS.\"\n\nIn this scenario, I have stated that static electricity ruined my motherboard. Everyone else has one very, VERY tiny view of what static electricity is. And for all intents and purposes? It[.] an incorrect view. I was vague, sure. It[.] possible that lightning struck my computer because I sat it on top of a hill with a flagpole attached in the middle of an April shower. But it[.] also possible, nay, PROBABLE, that I was wearing rubber soled sneakers and didn't ground myself properly, a charge built up, and then I touched the PC, leading to a shock which damaged the component. But your narrow view of the situation has ensured that you cannot and will not be able to enter any meaningful information into this discussion, because you fundamentally misunderstand what is being said in the first place.\n\nI know they think \"liberal_arts\" means \"those majors I don't like.\" I know that THAT is what they're discussing. They're still wrong, and they're potentially COMPLETELY changing the way this situation should be interpreted because they fundamentally don't understand the concepts they're talking about."}
