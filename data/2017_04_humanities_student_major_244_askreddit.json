She ultimately succeeded too. She was such a weird girl. Sexist against her own gender. Really had that \"I need to be the *Alpha Bitch Prime*\" attitude.\n\nFor one, she thought it was her right to say that I didn't deserve this job with the company because I didn't work hard enough..... ie my major wasn't the exact major of anyone else. We were all bullshit liberal_arts degree. Meanwhile, I handled an entire department by myself, physically moving and packing shit. I worked my ass off to secure a position with this company so seriously who the fuck was she to tell me off like that?\n\nShe denounced all my successes but put my mistakes on public blast, sometimes roping in a higher-up she could whine too while I sat uncomfortably.\n\nLavished over the other employee in our department (male) but would ignore me like dogshit on her shoe.\n\nAll my questions were met with by some serious attitude. Like it was a huge problem if I asked what would be in a shipment.... did I need a big container to wheel the stuff in or could I just physically grab it? She would yell at me.\n\nI don't throw around the word \"Cunt\" lightly but she[.] one of two women where I would scream that word at her face a 100 times. \n\n "}
