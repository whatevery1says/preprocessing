While I continue to love Philosophy greatly, for those that don't know there isn't hastily made progress in Philosophy and I enjoy progress. \n\nThese statements don't seem to logically follow. Progress isn't made quickly in the empirical and quantifiable subjects, if by that you mean subjects that use experimentation or math. The lab sciences in particular are extremely fickle progress-wise, because experiments frequently fail. \n\n I should note that I am a 4. 0 student and take this decision very seriously\n\nI don't get it. Why does your GPA have any bearing on how seriously you take this decision? I'd be taking the decision to start 10 years of indentured servitude with no hope of a job at the end pretty seriously if I had no GPA at all.\n\nIf I were to take a a guess, I'd say that you seem like the kind of person that needs to be admired, and you're noticing that humanities scholars aren't admired very much in our society, so you're looking for a subject that will make the construction workers on the street go wow, that guy is smart. Which is fine - I know lots of people in a variety of fields who go by that logic. But I'd drop the GPA schtick if you don't want to look completely ridiculous."}
