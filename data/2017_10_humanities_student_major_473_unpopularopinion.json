Let[.] see how many Antifa checks off, hm?  \n\nDisdain for human rights  \n\nCheck... but only those who don't believe what the Antifa retards believe.  \n\nIdentification of enemies / scapegoats as a unifying cause  \n\nCheck. Anyone who opposes the Antifa retards is automatically identified as a fascist.  \n\nRampant sexism  \n\nCheck. While most Antifa retards are male, they have disdain for \"white males\". That[.] both racism *and* sexism.  \n\nControlled mass media  \n\nCheck. Antifa retards are regularly defended throughout mass media as \"fighters of fascism\" and \"those trying to uphold American values\".  \n\nDisdain for intellectuals and the arts  \n\nCheck. If it offends (no matter if it[.] art or if it teaches something), it needs to be removed. Antifa retards are the antitheses of everything sensible and logical.  \n\nObsession with crime & punishment  \n\nCheck. Antifa retards are literally criminals, while claiming \"fascists\" need to be punished for their \"crimes\".  \n\nRampant cronyism & corruption  \n\nCheck. While most Antifa retards are Bern-victims, many of them supported (and still support) literally *the* most corrupt politician the country has ever seen in Hillary Clinton. They're funded by corrupt people *and* they're literally corrupting the minds of otherwise academically smart college students with their divisive rhetoric.  \n\nNow let[.] see... how about you attempting to tie Trump to each of those with non-narrative, non-rhetoric, objective facts, truth, and PROOF and see how far you get?  \n\n"}
