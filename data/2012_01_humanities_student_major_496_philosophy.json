A lot of my friends studying management and economics also pursue a second degree in one of the two aforementioned humanities precisely because they feel like their future jobs will do enough to dehumanize them.  One guy I know actually said that he'd be \"screwing over enough people\" in the years to come, and he wanted to study philosophy to make sure he didn't lose his soul. \n\nI think there[.] also something to be said about studying the Western (or Eastern!) intellectual tradition. There was a recent post in r/philosophy about why philosophy isn't actively taught in public high schools, and I think it[.] definitely because of this whole misguided idea that mathematics and the sciences are innately superior to the liberal_arts. I went to a really good public high school in a mostly upper middle class area, and in my last year one teacher created a philosophy elective. Now I would've absolutely taken it if I had the time, but only one person signed up for the class and it was turned into an independent study.\n\nAnd regarding the correlation between what you study in college and what your career is: I have a second cousin who earned a degree in geology, and he now works with a tech/media company."}
