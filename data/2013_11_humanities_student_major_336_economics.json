First of all, not everyone is cut out for a STEM degree. I work in higher ed, I run success analytics data, and over the past few years I've seen a massive spike in students running themselves into the ground and into extreme debt failing and retaking STEM course for degrees they simply aren't cut out for. \n\nHumanities are actually important to society. All of those 'worthless' degrees you talk about? Maybe not super lucrative in today economy. But I remember an economy that fully supported people with humanities degrees, and they didn't have to go massively in debt to get them. Society was much better off with a good chunk of the population that knew about history, sociology, psychology, political science. And another chunk that barely scraped by financially making really beautiful art. They never intended to get rich, but we once had [.]tarving artists' that weren't literally starving. \n\nAgain, we were much better off.\n\nRight now we have a very broken economy that is a result of a very broken system. And you want to blame everyone but the people that broke it. You want to point fingers at the people who suffer and blame them.\n\nEven if you are very wealthy, even you are suffering from the loss of people who study under those 'worthless' degrees. Society is much richer the more rounded it is."}
