It hasn't even quite been ten years since I graduated high school in North Mississippi.  Out of my graduating class of about 100, 4 of us went directly to a university.  The rest either attended a community college or immediately started working a dead end job.  Of those that went to community college, about 15 or so actually completed a bachelors degree.  Only three of us have received anything higher than a bachelors, and all three of us have moved out of the state.  \n\nWhen I started my first semester at Ole Miss, I couldn't believe how much other people knew than me.  I had a 4. 0 and a high ACT score in high school, but the kids that went to private schools or were from out of state had read so much more than me and been taught so much more.  In high school all of my humanities courses (except this history state tested one) were taught by coaches.  We just did worksheets and watched old tv specials.  I think I have watched the Mr. T musical about 30 times.  \n\nI could go on and on, but there isn't a high priority put on education.  That includes spending, bringing in good teachers, and the fact that a lot of people ridicule those of us that try learn as much as we can."}
