Although many schools have standards, there are a number of colleges whose only standard is - can you pay tuition?  Great, you're in.  In that case, why would they NOT offer a huge range of majors, regardless of career prospects?\n\n(By the way, myself and all my friends majored in some form of \"liberal_arts\".  I was a Communication Science major.  Intended to go to law school [the major was half public speaking and half the actual science behind communication, and was mostly people wanting to be lawyers], didn't, got a 6 figure job right out of college instead and am now rich.  All my friends are doing pretty well, although not quite on my echelon.  I don't believe that a liberal_arts education is useless, but I do believe there are MANY jobs out there requiring a liberal_arts education that do not actually need one, which also exacerbates the \"useless major\" issue.)\n\nThe European model of secondary education works well not only because it is free but because there is significantly less college enrollment.  People go to trade schools - so I agree with you there that those should also be free / subsidized.  And more jobs don't require secondary education.  Do you really need one to be an administrator?"}
