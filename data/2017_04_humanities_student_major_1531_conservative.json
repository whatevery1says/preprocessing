It[.] a great school with strong STEM/Business programs and some humanities are actually fairly apolitical. However, I will concede that people aren't very politically curious as a whole.\n\nI went to the school during what I felt was a pretty transitional period. Early on I remember attending a Ron Paul rally, it was exciting and you would see zero protests. It[.] where I registered to vote as a Republican and wasn't met any sort of animosity. Somewhere down the line, things changed. I didn't even think much of it when Romney lost, which was disappointing, but wasn't particularly uncivilized by any means - people just went on with their lives the next day. I think things started changing when BAMN started appearing more on campus, protests for Ferguson pretty much trashed Oakland and the highways and bled into Berkeley. I distinctly remember Peter Thiel getting protested. I left before the whole Trump thing came into the picture, but from what I hear from friends, they had things like puppies to comfort students, classes cancelled for grieving, and projects and exams delayed to allow people to recover from trauma. You'd think an actual humanitarian disaster happened or something.\n\nI'm proud of the school[.] legacy and I'm proud of what Reagan did as well, and I'm proud to be an alumnus, but they're not seeing a cent from me until things change."}
