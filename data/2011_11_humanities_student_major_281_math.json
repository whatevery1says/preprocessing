So she does CS theory and likes it a lot.\n\nOne part of your problem is clearly the \"bashing the liberal_arts\" element.  In *Pride and Prejudice*, Caroline Bingley says that she'd like dancing parties better if they were more rational and involved conversation, to which her brother replies: \"Much more rational, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a Ball.\"\n\nShe has missed the point: of course it[.] more rational to spend time doing geometry proofs, or studying chemistry.  But most people have many faculties besides reason, and it would be irrational to ignore those other elements of a rich human life.\n\nIt reads to me as if you're blaming mathematics for shutting you in a little box of pure reason and not experiencing the world.  But that can happen with any field of study; consider the stereotype of the CS major or the engineer who never leaves the lab.\n\nGo to the plays your university[.] theater department puts on.  Go to the art gallery and look at the student paintings and sculptures, or listen to a music major[.] piano performance.  Your student ID should get you in for cheap or even free, so there[.] no big loss.  Take someone with you, and talk about what you're looking at or what the people in the story did.\nDid you like something?  Did you not like something?\n\nWhatever you decide to do next, make sure you don't let your world shrink up around you again.\n"}
