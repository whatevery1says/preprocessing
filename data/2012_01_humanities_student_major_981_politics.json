This of course is a broad generalization, but one I've found personally to be somewhat true. Ever have that class in mathematics where students weren't ever going to go into anything which really required math, and they would ask things like \"do we really need to know this?\", or \"is this going to be on the test\", or \"oh my god I'm never going to use this shit!\"?  Well did you really get Marxism jammed down your throat?  There are plenty of people taking Algebra right now who are very upset that they have to learn about logarithms or the guass jordan elimination method too.  I'm not saying you're one of those closed minded people but it[.] possible. \n\nAlso unlike those classes one is required to take for engineering, those in in the humanities don't really have a \"right\" answer.  They tend to encourage people to critically think about, as well as learn about new material.  What tends to be more important then is how well a student can argue and relate to the material, while demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the material as well. Engineering students tend too often to think far too literally. Vagueness is something they're not as easily comfortable with in my experience. "}
