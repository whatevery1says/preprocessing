I'd defy anyone who thinks so to try taking a course like Advanced Topics in Critical and Cultural Theory, it[.] a lot of heavy, thick reading and analysis.\n\nThough I certainly feel like as far as public education goes, like low end sort of community college, liberal_arts is a joke because of the lower level of practicality resulting in lower levels of strictness - liberal_arts courses are often taken there in order to fulfill general education requirements.\n\nAnyhow, yeah, I do agree that liberal_arts degrees are less practical than just about any field at this point in our country[.] history... there[.] no market in our system for a scholar who is just a scholar. In some ways it[.] a shame, but that[.] how America has developed unfortunately. Once upon a time there was ample room for that sort of thing but the technology age has sort of edged it out. Even in my home in Germany there[.] not much desire for liberal_arts curriculum because the only realistic path nowadays is professor, or writer... and I think it[.] fairly obvious how contrastingly lucrative or meager a writer can be."}
