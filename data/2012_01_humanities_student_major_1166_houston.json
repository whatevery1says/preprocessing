It[.] a lot more conservative in Houston than it is in the other places I've lived, but it[.] tolerable. I haven't spent much time in other Texas cities/towns, so I can't compare Houston to the rest of the state. That said, Houston is by far the friendliest place I've ever lived, which more than counteracts how conservative it can be. \n\nJudging from your username, you'll want to stay far away from the many bible studies and religious groups on campus. It[.] not hard to learn to avoid them. Generally, if you just let people know you don't share their beliefs, they'll stop bothering you about it. Also, UH is extremely culturally diverse, meaning that many of our students are Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, whatever. It[.] a very tolerant campus in that respect.\n\nIf you want to hang out with some of the more liberal people in town, I highly recommend you apply for and join the Honors College. The Honors College is basically a tiny liberal_arts college in the middle of campus. People there are MUCH more liberal than the school and city as a whole. Also, the Honors College has the medicine and society program, which is a minor you'll want to seriously consider. I've heard (from friends who recruit for the Honors College) that everyone who gets through the program gets into graduate/pharmacy school."}
