Its a fact that the system is messed up, teachers have so many hoops they have to jump through otherwise they get sued or fired and that[.] a really depressing fact when I think of a seemingly amazing teacher that you seem to be Deradius while my math teacher senior year is legally blind and called me fat on multiple occasions in front of the class. As a concerned and educated student I appreciate all the work teachers do. Education is an important thing and without it our world would be nothing near what it is today. I appreciate all that you have done Deradius and ecmoRandomNumbers. Yes a lot of the country doesn't want to hear these but know that there are people who do care about what you do and more often than not they are the older students who have had you in the past and look back at the influence you have had on them and their parents who can see your devotion and character through the stories and reactions  their son or daughter has told them.\n\nThank you for all you have done over your careers."}
