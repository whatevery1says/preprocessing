After all, however inadvertently, her paper, and her map, have caused a thousand lazy writers on the net \u2013 and some first-rate historians, as well \u2013 to think of Poland as some sort of shining beacon in the grim history of mid-fourteenth century Europe. What on earth prompted her to identify the kingdom as an area \"*partiellement ou totalement epargnees par la peste*\" - partially or totally spared by the plague? What evidence did she cite, and how much detail did she go into? Could it be we're overlooking some crucial bit of evidence that she dug up half a century ago?\n\nWell, the answer to that final question is a resounding \"no\". Carpentier[.] paper mentions Poland only once, and pretty much in passing. She asserts that the country was \"only affected \u2013 weakly \u2013 in its northern part\", and notes in passing that the one Polish chronicle account familiar to her deals solely with Torun, a small town on the Vistula, and is in any case quite useless, being copied word for word from a French source. The problem requires further study, she suggests. Worse still, her brief passage is not footnoted or sourced, making it impossible to tell \u2013 without engaging in a major act of historiographical archaeology \u2013 how she was able to conclude that only northern Poland was visited by the Black Death. \n\nAll in all, it[.] staggering that Carpentier[.] short, casually-composed passage \u2013 and the map that she drew based on it \u2013 has had so massive an impact on plague studies. And it is, to put it as politely as I can, more than a little bit unfortunate that it unleashed a myth that[.] only getting ever more entrenched with every general survey of Polish history that[.] published, and every bit of internet clickbait written about the Black Death.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThis has necessarily been a long post, so **a tl;dr** seems sensible. I conclude:\n\n\u2022 There is currently no detailed, accurate demographic data for Poland in the period up to and after the Black Death that would allow us to extrapolate the number of deaths caused by the plague in this region, even very approximately, with confidence. Data for prices and wages from one major Polish city suggest an impact similar to that experienced in western Europe.\n\n\u2022 Poland was not sufficiently isolated from the rest of Europe for isolation to explain its apparent \"escape\" from plague. And it seems to be the case that it experienced a significant number of deaths, though \u2013 perhaps as a consequence of population densities \u2013 *possibly* fewer, in proportion, than more populous states did.\n\n\u2022 However, the difficulty of assessing the impact of the Black Death in the kingdom is increased by its integration into the eastern European trading economy of the 14th century. The flow of people and cash eastwards from Germany was sufficiently significant to obscure and confuse any attempt to measure the impact of the plague in Poland, both economically and demographically.\n\n\u2022 English-language studies draw on only a couple of contemporary chronicle accounts from the region, not enough to base any proper sort of study on \u2013 and these suggest that the impact of the Black Death in Poland was, if anything, at least as catastrophic as it was elsewhere in Europe. More detailed local records may be largely or wholly lacking; if they exist, they have not been the subject of studies that have had an impact in the English-speaking world. \n\n\u2022 Nonetheless, no peer-reviewed books and papers written by academic historians, at least in western European languages, suppose there was anything extraordinary about the passage of the plague through Poland. \n\nMore modern studies generally suppose that the country escaped relatively lightly in 1347-51, though they acknowledge that it was not *unaffected* by the plague, nor was it necessarily invulnerable to later outbreaks of epidemic. Since I have not yet come across any such work that cites more detailed surveys of the impact of the Black Death in the region, it may well be that even the writers of these studies are basing their ideas about Poland an the plague on Carpentier and her (unreferenced, 55-year-old) work.\n\n\u2022 Mention of the actions of Casimir the Great in blocking the borders of Poland, or of the idea that the reluctance of Poles to kill cats helped to retard the spread of disease there, exist only in popular books and on the internet; such suggestions only began to appear after 1995. They do appear not to have been made by specialists in Polish history, nor does there seem to be any evidence at all that they are true. It seems more likely they are post-hoc rationalisations, brainwaves dreamed up to explain Poland[.] supposed escape from the ravages of the Black Death.\n\n\u2022 The idea that areas of Europe (including Poland and Milan) \"escaped\" or almost escaped the impact of the epidemic can be traced to incautious reading and recopying of a map *showing preliminary conclusions only* regarding the spread of the disease first published by Carpentier in 1962, and widely republished in English-language popular works from 1969.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[General note: there is a large void in studies of medieval Poland. The literature is relatively abundant up to c. 1250 and after the Union of Krewo in 1385, but I have struggled to find much written in the past 50 years, in any language, devoted to the history of Poland after 1250 and before its union with Lithuania, much less a study of the impact of the Black Death there. Benedictow \u2013 who devotes a chapter to the question \"Did Some Countries or Regions Escape?\" \u2013 acknowledges that the dearth of studies of Poland makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the impact of the epidemic there.]\n\nHollee Abbee, \"[Cats and the Black Plague](https://owlcation. com/humanities/Cats-and-the-Black-Plague),\" Owlcation 4 February 2010, accessed 29 October 2017\n\nWilhelm Abel, *Agrarkrisen und Agrarkonjunktur: Eine Geschichte der Land- und Ernahrungswirtschaft Mitteleuropas seit dem hohen Mittelalter* (1966)\n\nPerry Anderson, *Lineages of the Absolutist State* (1974)\n\nOle J Benedictow, *The Black Death, 1346\u20131353: The Complete History* (2004)\n\nHenry Buckle, *Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works* (1872)\n\nNorman Cantor, *The Black Death and the World It Made* (2001)\n\nElisabeth Carpentier, \"Autour de la Peste Noire: Famines et epidemies dans la histoire du XIVe siecle,\" *Annales*, XVII (1962)\n\nAlice Creviston, \"[Economic, social and geographical explanations of how Poland avoided the Black Death](https://rucore. libraries. rutgers. edu/rutgers-lib/47644/PDF/1/),\" Rutgers undergraduate paper 2015.\n\nNorman Davies, *God[.] Playground: A History of Poland* (1982)\n\nGeorge Deaux, *The Black Death, 1347* (1969)\n\nJM Doll et al, \"Cat transmitted fatal pneumonic plague in a person who travelled from Colorado to Arizona.\" *American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene* 51 (1994)\n\nChristopher Dyer, 'Rural Europe.'
