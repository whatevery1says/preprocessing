Along the lines of \"Hey I want to like my work, and provide for my family.\" There are plenty of subjects that I myself am interested in, but I wouldn't consider majoring in them. Personal fulfillment is great, and should be a factor in choosing a major. But fulfillment does fill the gas tank, pay rent, or put food on the table.\n\nI'm also in the (probably minority) that absolutely loathes anything remotely related to GenEd. I was MechE at Cal. My department (at least at the time) had the most requirements out of any major at Cal due to the breadth of knowledge required to be a MechE. I had to get \"GenEd\" AND \"General Engineering Education\" as well (had to take programming, electrical engineering courses, etc.). Forcing people to take classes in something they don't enjoy (I really really dislike humanities courses is a FANTASTIC way to breed resentment. If I had been allowed to take econ or finance or business courses as my GenEd, I'd be more inclined to be on the side of \"do whatever you want.\" But this whole \"be a well-rounded individual\" crap? Waste of time.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm currently in an MBA program, because there will come a time when I can't keep up with the younger engineers leaving school. And because I want decision making power to combat climate change. AND $$$ of course."}
