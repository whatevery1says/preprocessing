Probably was a good idea. (EDIT: also, the Wright brothers had full-time jobs running a bicycle shop, so this isn't the greatest example)\n\nIf you're going to pursue art, or anything other than a high-status and high-income career, you're going to have to do it for *yourself*. Society is going to have its opinions, and for the vast majority of people pursuing careers in the arts, that opinion is valid - you won't make much money, you probably won't make much of a difference, you would probably be \"better off\" doing something else. But that doesn't matter. The whole point of living in a free society is that people should be allowed to pursue their own happiness.\n\nIf you're expecting people to stop \"disrespecting\" artists, you're fighting a losing battle. If you want people to stop \"disrespecting\" *you* as an artist, then make art that accomplishes something. But if you just want to make art, then make art, and rise above the opinions of the people you \"have to interact with from time to time\"."}
