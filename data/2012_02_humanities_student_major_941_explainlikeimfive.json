I had to go to community college for 4 some years until I matured enough to get my head together to pass courses.\n\nI applied to many schools and heard **NO** from every single one.  I then decided to focus on a farily large public school where my past could slip under the radar.  They said **NO** to my inital application to their Bioengieering school.  **NO** to an application to their general Engineering degree.  \n\nI then decided to apply to the Arts & Sciences and just take Engineering courses after I got in, and got a big **NO** to a general Art[.] & Sciences degree.\n\nFinally I applied to their school for \"continuing education\" at the Uni, like someone would do if they wanted to switch industries after years of working in a single one.  I finished 2 years later with a bachelors in Neuroscience (its quite easy to change degrees once you are in anywhere) and now I'm attending a top school for Bioengineering masters program and should be wrapping up by this time next year.\n\nYou can do anything with any GPA, just expect to hear and work past a lot of **NO** before you hear the \"ya sure, why not?\".  An above average GPA just makes all the application process easier on your time and monetary debt.  \n\n"}
