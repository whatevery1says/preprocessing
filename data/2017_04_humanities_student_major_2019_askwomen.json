My family was well off but very toxic, and didn't want to pay for anything for us kids (they'd restrict food and heat too). At first I didn't get any financial aid because the FAFSA showed my family to be well off, but my mother called and told them some manipulation so suddenly I had about 2/3 of tuition covered in grants by the college. She had me do a lot of work and writing to apply for outside scholarships. There was still a gap in the tuition cost of a total of $15K for the whole 4 years. She forged my signature on student loan documents to borrow that and refused to tell me how much she borrowed (I found out later when I repaid). I also learned years later that my father sent her that $15K so I could graduate without debt, but she kept it for herself and made me repay the loans.\n\n**Second time** - I was 30 and wanted to become a nurse through a community college. I paid out of pocket, from my husband[.] and my savings, on a credit card each semester.\n\n**Third time** - I wanted to advance my nursing degree so I'd have a bachelor[.] rather than just an associate[.]. I was working in a hospital and they gave a few thousand per year in free tuition assistance. That covered about half my tuition, the rest I put on a credit card. I was going to school part_time while working, it took 2 years to get the bachelor[.] degree."}
