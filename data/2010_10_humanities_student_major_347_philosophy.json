Good luck trying to get *anyone* in the public to put medical science or almost any engineering discipline below any subject in the humanities.  That is not to say the humanities are less important in terms of academic pursuits, or that they provide less benefit to humanity as a whole, just that the benefits are largely less tangible than that of science.  Less tangible means less exposure and subsequent interest from the public, which serves to cultivate the academic climate illustrated by the video - which, I would think, has been developing for several years.\n  \n Condescending bullshit.  \n  \nI find it funny that you'd accuse science of condescension towards humanities; the most arrogant people I know are almost exclusively in the humanities.  Journalists appear to be the worst, closely followed by law, if anecdotal remarks are worth anything (they're not, I know)  \n  \n**EDIT** I should be clear: I am talking about my personal experience regarding arrogant humanities staff/students; I'm fully aware that this changes from country to country and, indeed, university to university.  At the end of the day, I don't see why there should be any friction, as the luddities in key political positions are who we should *all* be angry at."}
