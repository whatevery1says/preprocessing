We have several \"second career\" students in the department, and in fact I often get teased for being young! A lot of people go into it hoping to avoid math but if you want to go to grad school, you'll need at least a year of calculus (but no diff eq[.] unless you wanna go geophysics or modeling). I'm personally in the hydro geochem side, so I study groundwater quality. Re-reading your description, there[.] currently a student in our department who got his first BA in English, completed a year and a half of geo courses to get his requirements and then went smoothly into the grad program. In fact, writing skills that you've learned from the humanities (which are sadly not sufficiently emphasized in most science undergrad programs) will set you apart from other candidates. SO MANY science grad students struggle with the mountains of writing.... grants, proposal, thesis, we're always writing! \n\nAnyway if you have any other specific questions about geology or being a lady geo, ask away! I love advocating for my field because I'm so passionate about it (and I'm sure as /u/digimer knows, that[.] extremely common among geologists!) Geology is in no way just about rocks, and I'm sure the same kinda things you'll find fascinating in paleo are what you'd love about geology! (e. g. field work, learning about the past)"}
