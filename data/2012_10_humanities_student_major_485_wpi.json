I don't learn well that way.\n\nI also loved that every class is taught by a professor, not some TA nobody can understand and you learn nothing.\n\nAnd I loved that I could pick my own classes. Instead of being told I had to take English 101 I had an assortment of humanities classes from which I could choose, so I chose mostly music classes. I wish there had been some art, not just art history, but I am glad I studied music.\n\nI liked the 7 week classes. Semester classes are broken up, not condensed (I took calc 1 through 5). It[.] nice to have a break after 7 weeks.\n\nI'm not gay, but I recall the campus being pretty tolerant. There are always douches, but over all I would say the campus was moderate. Hate wasn't tolerated, but neither was militant asshatism by unhinged lefties. WPI is not a school that will ever need a \"free speech zone.\" I can only think of one incident like that -- some students stole every copy of the student newspaper to censor an article critical of the BSU at another school for having black-only policies.  Other than that you will see ROTC marching on campus and students attending vegan socialist gatherings down town and everyone pretty much got along.\n\nEdit: and oh yeah I LOVED the IQP. I spent half a semester having the time of my life in Bangkok and the mountains of northern Thailand."}
