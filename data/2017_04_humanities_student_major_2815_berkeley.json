While it has a majority of STEM majors humanities also live here and it has proximity to both co-ops and frats. If you are worried about too many dudes well there is Stern Hall which is all female. Suites are either highly social or not at all depending on the luck of the draw. Houses the Rowing, Rugby, and Lacrosse teams.\n\nClark Kerr: Where the parties happen. It is the farthest from campus but one could argue the nicest rooms. It use to have a stereotype of being full of attractive athletes but now the sports teams are redistributed. Houses the football team.\n\nUnits 1/2\nThese are effectively the same. Both are relatively close to campus with a wide variety of majors and nearby restaurants if you get sick and tired of Crossroads. No athletic teams that I know of. And Unit 1 has RAs that ooze fake enthusiasm.\n\nUnit 3\nThis shit is ratchet. Same major distribution as 1 and 2 but with way more shenanigans according. The amount of stories I have heard about people getting blowjobs in stairwells and jumping out of windows to avoid the RAs from the RAs is absurd. Also has a Vegan/Vegetarian/Kosher dining hall.... make that what you will. It also hosts the swim and water polo teams I believe.\n\nYour source: Resident Assistant who has worked/lived in all styles of residence hall and seen shit hit the fan more times than most."}
