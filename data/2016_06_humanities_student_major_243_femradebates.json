Women were barred/banned from certain areas of colleges but they were never outright excluded.  As if you look at the history of colleges you find women did in fact take part.  Tho it was often in limited areas primary liberal_arts.  Over time this has changed and in the 21st century least in the first world countries there is no part of college that excludes women.  It has actually flip in that men are starting to be excluded if you will from female dominated  majors, but that is another topic.\n\nI think it[.] extremely important for people to know that women shaped history too, not just men.\n\nThere is no denying that, I think its more a question of how much.  I am no history buff, but from what I have read about history (this is going past that what I had to learn in high school which was largely crap) it seem to me women while having a hand in history and at times a key role, they secondary to men.  Its easy to say this is due to gender roles, but I think its more a matter of one[.] position.  As you talk about how men stole or took credit from women, how many time did men do that to other men?
