My instructor was ex ufc and at the time he seemed intimidating as hell. No way was I gonna ask him if he had a black belt in brazilian jiu jitsu, while he was teaching and wearing a black belt during our jiu jitsu class. To me-that is a death sentence. Its implied. \n\n\nPut it this way, if I was taking a microbio class and I see that my professor has a PhD in front of their name, I shouldnt have to ask if they have their doctorate in biology. If I found out that they actually had their doctorate in Psychology or Liberal Arts I would feel like I had been lied to. The implication is the reason why this is an issue. I understand the position of black belt in any martial art. It is a huge accomplishment and one that people literally spend their entire life sometimes trying to obtain. But if you cant humble yourself and remember that you are not a blackbelt in another art and put on a whitebelt or in this case bluebelt then you are not being honest with yourself. And if you cant be honest with yourself first, how can you be honest with your students. I understand that you have your own curriculum, but that is a bullshit excuse."}
