(Does anyone use anything they \"learned\" from classes like these? Does anyone even remember anything they \"learned\"?)   \n\nSeriously, this should be taught in HS. What is sad is, they don't even teach these things in college either. In my liberal_arts school (good thing I was an econ major), it was required to take culture/arts classes but they never made you take basic finance. It[.] amazing how many people don't know what inflation really means and that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. EVERYONE should know this. They should teach you how to pay your god damn bills and how to save/invest properly. Instead, they required us to take a class about sounds, film or art. (oh, we had to pay for these classes too)\n\nI'm not saying they should get rid of these classes entirely; instead, I think these arts classes should be OPTIONAL -- not required. A basic finance class where they teach you how to pay your bills and keep a budget should be the required class. \n\n"}
