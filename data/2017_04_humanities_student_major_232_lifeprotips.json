Don't focus on the liberal_arts courses because sometimes they change the curriculum or they're too easy to fail. \n \n\n*Make sure you sell notes for a class that[.] offered by your major[.] department exclusively and that only those studying your major can take it.*\n \n\nMath classes work too. You can sell **Dropbox** or **Google Drive** links as well. Cloud links are useful when you can't meet the person and give him/her physical copies. Make sure your PayPal or Amazon works. People are willing to buy you gift cards too.\n \n\n**Happy hustling! Hope this is useful for you and hope that it works out.** I would love to know if this worked out for you if possible. \n \n\n*PS: If you didn't go to college and have books, you could potentially try the same method. People always want books. Go join Facebook groups or post stuff on eBay. [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=WwhP754Cqw0&t=11s) talks about this a lot. There[.] a lot of information he gives out on side hustling. Check it out!*\n \n\n**EDIT -** **Disclaimer:** *Check your student code of conduct/academic integrity policIes before you decide to do this. As suggested, it could constitute a violation. Nonetheless, I find that the methods you can use to do this can be used for other items.*"}
