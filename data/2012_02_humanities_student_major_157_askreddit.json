Nothing should just be memorized.  You must get to that special point of understanding in which you suddenly see everything fits into place.  You can't see a broken car without breaking it down like a physics problem.  You can't watch a movie without noting the themes.  You can't just make a political argument without considering both sides and weighing the options to come to some thesis.  You can't talk about some historical anecdote without thinking about the context and time period.  You'll start to realize why it[.] important to cite sources and provide sound arguments.  You'll see why smart people pick really specific positions to defend, instead of selecting huge, general positions.  But, I digress.\n\nFor science and math courses, you must do practice problems.  Lots of them.  Don't study or memorize the generalized forms or algorithms.  You'll stare at them for half an hour, murmur that you don't know what[.] so hard, and then end up freaking out during an exam when you come across anything the least bit tricky.  Find as many practice problems as you can of varying difficulty and subject (don't just pick ones you can already do quickly), solve them as best you can, and visit the professor with ones you can't.  For Chemistry/Biology in particular, you must memorize things.  Tons of things.  Commit that shit to memory.  No getting around it.\n\nFor any kind of humanities courses like History or Philosophy, you just need to read and read for understanding.  With some professors, you can read through stuff to get the main points of what[.] going on and that will suffice, especially for essay-based exams.  This method prepares you more for academia anyway because often you won't have time to read for incredible detail, so it[.] important you train your brain to seek out the useful points and ignore the fluff.  However, for multiple choice exams (as a TA, I think these degrade the college experience), you must read for all the details, especially for seemingly \"irrelevant\" things like exact dates or names.  Certainly, if you are considering a humanities major, then you need to understand the importance of knowing dates and names, but as a science/math person myself, I can understand how easy it is to not care when a certain thing happened so long as it happened.\n\nFor language courses like German or Spanish, find a study group and practice speaking.  Flash cards are great until that first oral exam or when half your grade comes from participation in class discussion.  Hell, in my freshman German class (I placed into the 300 level), I had to give a 35 minute presentation in German to the class for 30% of my final grade."}
