If I received this e-mail, of course I would respond with a condolence.  If said student then e-mailed me a follow up saying something akin to \"OMG, my brother did this.  I do NOT have cancer and need no accommodation for the course\", I'd laugh it off and be done with it.   I'd probably follow up with the student in private just to make sure everything was OK.\n\nGiven that all of your classes are online and you never actually see your professor, I'd be inclined to keep my mouth shut.  The ONLY danger with regard to this is if one (or more) of them actually teach in-person classes at your University.  Profs are human -- we talk.  It MAY come up in the course of conversation that you have cancer with other teachers.  So if that does happen, you may have to do some talking to profs.\n\nI can't speak for every prof -- but I don't think you'd be called a liar by many.  And if you own up to your brother[.] actions (not sure if the best way to word it, but meh) quickly, most will either forget it happened...... or know you as \"that girl who has a crazy brother\"  (said jokingly)."}
