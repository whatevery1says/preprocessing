It covers a lot of fields is a key word for: not specialized, and very general. General degrees are NOT any good. A business degree is good, but if you go general business you're an idiot. Science majors are good, but if you go general science, you're an idiot. The point of college is to specialize in a field of study, getting a general degree won't do shit for you. See, like you said, you did music therapy. It might not be the highest paying major on average, but it[.] better than a general major. Like, I'm getting in to the business school after this term. I would be an idiot to focus in general business. I need to choose a focus like: Finance, Accounting, Entrepreneurship, etc. Not just general. If you go general there will always be a ton of people will a specialized degree applying for the job you want, and you're sitting there with a degree that slightly covers the field you are applying to get in to. Yeah, general degrees are good if you don't know what you want to get in to. But if you really don't know what you want to get in to, you shouldn't be paying for college yet. If you are going to choose a liberal_arts sub degree, then you would have to go very specialized to make it worth anything at all."}
