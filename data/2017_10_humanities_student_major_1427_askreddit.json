Here are the most common ones:\n\nNo, they are not related. \n\nNo, I will not tell you my birth name or show you a picture of me before I transitioned. \n\nNo, I do not think a liberal_arts field would be \"more suited to someone like me\", I like my chemistry and forensic science double major just fine. \n\nNo, I am not emotionally unstable/fragile/more sensitive than other people. \n\nNo, I will not change my mind and detransition. I haven't in the past 3 years and I really don't think I'll just wake up one day and say \"huh, maybe I should've stayed a girl the whole time. Gotta re-attach my boobs now\".\n\nNo, I don't believe you when you said you could tell the whole time. Most people can't because I'm pretty far in transition and trans people don't look inherently different from cis people.\n\nYes, my parents still love me.\n\nYes, I plan to get married someday.\n\nYes, I plan to have kids and no, I don't plan to carry them. Adoption is more suited to my needs. \n\nYes, I do get offended when you say transphobic or homophobic things. Maybe because you're directly attacking people like me or something. \n\nYes, I have been a guy my whole life, even the parts of my life when I didn't live as one."}
