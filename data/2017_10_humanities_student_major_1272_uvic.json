My advice would be not to worry too much about your lab marks.  In subjects like Physics, the lab marks are not well correlated with overall performance in the course.  You are probably going to get better value for your time by studying for exams and doing assignment than trying to further optimize lab grades.\nYou are welcome to ask TAs (or anybody who marks you) for some feedback, but don't go into it with the expectation that they will (or should) change the marks.  What I tell the TAs doing labs in the courses I coordinate is that I want them to consistently apply the relevant standards within the sections they mark.  It[.] my job (as coordinator) to take that raw data and use it to inform my assessment of what the overall mark should be.  (For example, if you hear somebody got an A+ in a Physics class at MIT you will have a different opinion than if they got an A+ in a Physics class at an online college.)\n\n2. In Physics (and Astronomy) the lab TAs job description is to deliver the lab, and then to mark the work that was submitted.  They are not paid to/supposed to help students prepare for exams.  In the Humanities there may be very different expectations about what a TAs job it. "}
