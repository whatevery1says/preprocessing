Like what someone said above/below, the best part about UofT are the choices. Mine is pretty specific (East Asia) and compared to my biology courses which still has 1000+ people, all of my courses in the arts have max. 45 people. It could just be that the department is pretty small (I believe the intro/biggest class was 350 or so) but smaller classes definitely give your experience a more personal feel. I don't know what history/anthro are like but I had a lot of tutorials for EAS and that[.] where I made most of my friends. More often than not, I went to a lot of office hours because I had so many questions and I learned so much. My love for the sciences will never diminish, but the experience that the arts (especially my major) has given me has been relatively great so far. And again, I don't know what history/anthro are like, but from my experiences with the arts courses here, they'll turn you into really great writers. I look at history in a completely different way than I did in high school. Join lots of clubs, go to office hours, be active in tutorials and you'll make your experience really personal and enjoyable."}
