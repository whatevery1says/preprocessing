Hence, median GPAs at those schools is actually like 3. 9, with a lot of humanities_major. Probably still fine at Northwestern or Columbia if your LSAT is high enough. Check https://www. reddit. com/r/lawschooladmissions/ but I think they'd concur.\n\nYou also need to think hard on whether you really want to do a JD/MBA. You need strong reasons to answer the \"why MBA\" question, and doubly so for a JD/MBA. You don't want to be seen as someone looking to collect degrees.\n\nMBA is a very holistic process, law is not. My co-worker got into Harvard and Stanford law with a 3. 9 GPA and 176 LSAT and 760 GMAT, didn't even get an interview at Harvard, Wharton, and Booth since he only had 2 years of experience at matriculation and no good narrative for why MBA.\n\nAs far as ECs, get involved with your community. If you're interested in politics, it[.] a very active time to be involved e. g., fighting for immigration rights. Just as important is figuring out your why MBA reason."}
