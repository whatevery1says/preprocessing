As we already has quite a lot assets done already, having them emulate our current artstyle was obviously main concern. The workflow is as follows - I start a map and do some basic stuff in it (wall, ground tiles, major features) and then I pass it over to one of them to finish it up and we tweak things as we go.\n\nBecause they're building on top of already started map, the artstyle is pretty much \"in their face\" so it[.] pretty hard to deviate from it. I expect that further down the line, after they get fully accustomed to it I'll be able to let them start maps by themselves (and I bloody well hope so, because that[.] the most un-fun part for me). Enemies and NPCs will come later - since we'll already have backgrounds for them, it'll be really easy to \"fit-them in\".\n\nAdvice on looking for artists that can \"fit in\" someone[.] else style. To my surprise, it[.] actually not that common - try to look for portfolios that display vast array of art styles - even if it[.] pixelart, there are still different aesthetics, and chances are that if someone was able to learn and emulate a lot of them, one more will not be an issue."}
