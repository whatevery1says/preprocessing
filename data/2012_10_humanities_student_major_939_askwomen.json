I'm a liberal_arts major, though. Lots of my female friends have also dated men in the sciences, and some of them are in the sciences themselves. \n\nI love the smarts, I love the ambition, and I love the curiosity about the world. I think my friends like all these things, too. \n\nStuff I don't like:\nLack of time to do stuff. I know it can't be helped since people in science can get busy with schoolwork, research, and jobs, but you're going to have to make time if you want to meet people. I think not spending a lot of time around other people is part of what makes a lot of people in science/math fields socially awkward. \n\nDon't be condescending to other people about your intelligence. You're smart. We know. If you act condescending toward me, at least, I'm going to be instantly put off and want to leave the situation. And please, don't be condescending about interests outside of math and science. I like to write and I like to draw, if you tell me these things are worthless I will not like you. \n\n\"I can do this way better!\" Unless you're actually going to improve a part of daily life, don't vocally complain about it all the time. It[.] annoying. "}
