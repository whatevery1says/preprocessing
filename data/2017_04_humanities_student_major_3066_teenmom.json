At least in the US, universities are moving away from giving professors full time tenure-track positions and instead are choosing to hire adjuncts to teach courses in these areas. Adjuncts get paid peanuts. I'm currently a graduate student at a pretty good public university. I get paid a stipend to work as a graduate assistant. Since I'm approaching the end of the program, my assistantship job now is to teach an undergraduate class. With my stipend (which is pathetically small btw), I actually get paid more to teach an undergraduate class than my friends who adjunct at the same university. It[.] kinda fucked.\n\nETA: Here[.] another thing that is even more fucked. A requirement for my graduate program is that you take a 3 credit seminar about college teaching and you teach an undergraduate course along with that. That is what I did the first semester I taught. When you do this, they don't pay you at all for teaching. I'm a fully funded student so I don't pay tuition or for my credits. However, there are some students in my program who are not funded and pay for their tuition and credits. That means these students, not only don't get paid to teach, but end up paying the university (the cost of 3 credits) in order to teach an undergraduate course. Sorry for getting off topic but this is so messed up and really pisses me off."}
