Student[.] Union was fairly priced for food and drink when I was there (massive Full English for only 4 quid!). 70:30 girl to guy ratio when I was there (and mostly attractive drama students.)\n\nCons: Absolutely appalling administration (colloquially known as being \"Bath Spa'd\") coupled with the reputation of being a mediocre liberal_arts university means that if your course isn't a PGCE or taught at Sion Hill, you're completely wasting your time. Sadly this attitude filters down to the student body after the first month and they become very lackadaisical and disengaged so conversation isn't particularly stimulating but hey ho, I'm a snob on such matters. Bath is also pretty expensive to live in.\n\nI should visit more places in the UK but I feel confident in declaring Bath is the best city in the UK. Arty, affluent, beautiful, lots going on (or near to other places with lots going on), it feels like a place you can completely unwind in and despite my earlier negative statement about the high cost of living, it[.] doable to work a minimum wage job and live in Bath (you just need an enormous slice of fortune when looking for leases). Easily the best 3 years of my life and I wish I were still there now."}
