Helps with what? I'm assuming job. It helps you get a job. \n\nHowever I would say if you hate the thought of being an engineer or whatever and you love the kind of things people study on a liberal_arts degree then do a friggin liberal_arts degree. Don't torture yourself by taking a technical based degree you hate so that you can get a well paying job in a field you also hate so you can work until retirement doing a thing you hate to earn money so you can keep going on and on and on doing a thing you hate. \n\nI have a liberal_arts degree and a job. I originally studied engineering. I hated engineering and i was a kinda middle of the class student. I changed degree and graduated with a first class honours degree (UK system) because the fun thing about studying something you love is that it doesn't feel like a task. It becomes super easy to get pretty fucking good at it. \n\nSo I have a job and a liberal_arts degree. And although it[.] \"harder\" to get a job in the sense that there are less jobs per graduate than in a technical field it[.] a lot easier to be in the top 10% of your graduating class if you love the shit out of what you do. So for me, it was probably easier to get a job with a liberal_arts degree than if I'd continued with a technical degree I hated. "}
