Having taken most of electives I have gained nothing important from them. Explain to me how some of the junky business courses help at all? Especially with co-op in the mix?\n\n\nI understand taking certain courses for prerequisite needs or just to have a baseline. Yes, I think everybody should take an English course - just to have the skillset. But some pie in the sky argument about being well rounded seems like someone is pushing their view of life on you.\n\n\n\nThe problem is, the current system says that even if you aced every single computer science course, missing a course in the humanities still means you cannot obtain your degree. In today[.] society, your degree is there way people label your skillset. A school knows that you have to obtain the degree to be a viable member in society so they use that position to push you to do whatever they want.\n\n\nIn the case of the math faculty, I think just removing ridiculous restriction of the 10 non-math courses non math would be hugely beneficial\n\n\nAnd lastly, the problem is that universities still have the best instructors  and equipment. You will not get the same quality of education at a college. Also employers do not view a degree and diploma in the same way. A degree is a better use of your time, but that doesn't mean it[.] without fault."}
