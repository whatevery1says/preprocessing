If you're going into something that has no immediate and directly applicable job prospects (undergrad in psychology, sociology, liberal_arts, etc.), then I think student loans are foolish. If you want to go study French Literature, awesome, pursue your dream. But do it one or two classes at a time, pay for it as you go, work full time and take 8 years to complete it. \n\nIf your degree has no immediate job prospects, it[.] not an investment, it[.] a hobby. If you want a hobby, awesome. The most interesting people I know all have passionate hobbies. But you wouldn't go $50k into debt to build an awesome model train set. It makes no sense to do the same for a degree that has only intellectual value.\n\nNow, there ARE some degrees that have immediate and very lucrative job prospects. Chemical engineering is certainly one of those. If you're studying this, fuck taking one or two classes at a time and working at the pizza joint at $8 per hour. Take 20 credit hours and get through school as fast as possible. When you get that degree, you'll be making $30+ per hour. Take out the loans you need and get the degree over with. In situations like this, it is literally the best financial investment you will ever make."}
