The alternative perspective is this:\n\nI have an English degree and no master[.]. I make about $80,000 and work from home. It[.] not a fortune, but my job is squarely in my field of study, and I love what I do. Many of the bad stats for english_major stem from the fact that the field attracts more than its fair share of aimless, low-aptitude students who are fearful of other fields and not particularly driven to excel at anything. If that[.] you, look elsewhere. If you're willing to fanatically pursue doing the work you love, you'll probably be fine.\n\nThat being said, look for a job that capitalizes on your being from Brunei, and don't move until you're hired. Translation may make your brain hurt or whatever, but the US is a very shitty place to be an unemployed immigrant with no familial safety net. You'll find that most institutions are nearly completely indifferent to your situation. You're having trouble getting a job? Tough. You can't afford health insurance? Tough. You don't have such-and-so immigration form to lease an apartment? Tough. \"But where will I go?\" \"Not my problem.\"\n\nAll of these things can be accomplished, but they often require massive persistence and initiative on your part."}
