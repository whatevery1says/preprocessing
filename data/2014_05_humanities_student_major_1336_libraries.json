I did my English Masters first and planned to go on to a Ph. D. I didn't even know library school was an option when I did my English degree. \n\nI had gone straight from undergrad to my Masters program so I knew I would take some time off after that to work and apply to Ph. D. programs, it was during that time that I discovered library school and really started to consider it as an option.  I ended up choosing library school because being a university librarian would provide me with many of the elements that made me want to go into academia in the first place working with faculty and students, working for a university, teaching, the opportunity to do research, and attend conferences.  Additionally a library degree was another 2 year degree rather than 6-8 years, and while I knew that the job market would be tough it was still better than the job market for a newly minted humanities Ph. D.  \n\nI also did a lot of research before deciding on library school and it seemed to indicate that having my first Masters degree would help me to get jobs in University libraries once I got my library degree, so it helped that I felt I would be able to utilize both of my graduate degrees towards a future career path.
