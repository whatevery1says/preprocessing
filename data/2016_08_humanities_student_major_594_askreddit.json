I'm a rising third year at an American research university that[.] got a great undergrad and graduate biochem program. My experiences are tinged by that lens, so if you're going to a small liberal_arts school, it may be a bit different, but should largely be a similar experience.\n\nPros:\n*Great research opportunities all over the place (many with publication opportunities)\n*Smaller and more tight-knit classes once you get past the weed out classes\n*Great career opportunities if you get a higher degree (PhD, MD, etc)\n\nCons:\n*Hard work. Lots of it. You're going to spend a lot of time in classes that will challenge you, and you'll need to really put in the work.\n*If you don't get a higher degree, career opportunities are highly limited.\n*If your university is like mine, you'll probably drop the major; 80-90% of incoming first years at my school that are biochem majors graduate with a biology degree instead because it[.] really hard. You basically need to fall in love with chemistry and biology.\n\nOn the whole, I don't regret my major one bit! I actually came in as a chemistry major but took a molecular biology class my first quarter and fell in love with the subject.\n\nIf you have any other questions or want general advice, feel free to PM me! Congrats on graduating, and good luck in college!"}
