They're a little drier since they're generally from philosophical writers, but they're also pretty fascinating!\n\nWalter Benjamin[.] [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://www. marxists. org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin. htm) isn't too long a read and it[.] a classic, very frequently assigned in all sorts of college courses on philosophy, art history, and critical theory. It addresses art, industrialism, capitalism, and more and is pretty digestible. \n\nGuy Debord[.] [Society of the Spectacle](https://www. marxists. org/reference/archive/debord/society. htm) is also widely assigned. It[.] longer but it[.] broken up into very small pieces and you don't have to read the whole thing by any means.\n\nJean Baudrillard[.] [Simulacra and Simulations](http://www. humanities. uci. edu/mposter/books/Baudrillard,%20Jean%20-%20Selected%20Writings_ok. pdf) (PDF) is another good read. It[.] chapter 7 in that PDF. \n\nRoland Barthes' [The Death of the Author](http://www. tbook. constantvzw. org/wp-content/death_authorbarthes. pdf) is one of my absolute favorites, it[.] pretty short and a really fascinating read.\n\nThere are also tons of videos on youtube of people talking about philosophy, critical theory and so on. Just do a youtube search for \"introduction to critical theory\" or some topic you found that you want more info on (\"simulacra and simulations,\" \"lacan and the real,\" etc.). You'd be surprised at what you can find.\n\nAlso, Slavoj Zizek has made a few movies that are really funny and fantastic. He[.] a bizarre guy but he does a great job of applying difficult theory to pop culture. If you're at all into film and philosophy, check out [The Pervert[.] Guide to Cinema](http://www. imdb. com/title/tt0828154/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2) (which I haven't seen yet, admittedly) and/or [The Pervert[.] Guide to Ideology](http://www. imdb. com/title/tt2152198/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (which I have seen and is great; you don't need to watch the other first, it doesn't matter). I also really like [this article](http://www. lacan. com/zizekrumsfeld. htm) by Zizek on Donald Rumsfeld[.] \"known knowns,\" though you may be a little young for the reference!\n\n*Applied theory etc.* - These are articles in all sorts of popular publications that explore the topics that philosophers and theorists are interested in. If you like these articles, seek out more from those publications or the authors or just by googling the topic:\n\n[Is Spam Art?](http://www. theparisreview. org/blog/2014/09/03/postcards-from-another-planet/) by Dan Piepenbring for The Paris Review.\n\n[Is SimCity Homelessness a Feature or a Bug?](http://motherboard. vice. com/read/is-simcity-homelessness-a-bug-or-a-feature) by Emanuel Maiberg for Motherboard.\n\n[The Paranoid Style in American Politics](http://harpers. org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/) by Richard Hofstadter for Harpers (1964, this one[.] a little older but a classic).\n\n[China bans wordplay in attempt at pun control](https://www. theguardian. com/world/2014/nov/28/china-media-watchdog-bans-wordplay-puns?CMP=twt_gu) by Tania Branigan for the Guardian.\n\n[Is it O. K. to be a Luddite?](https://www. nytimes. com/books/97/05/18/reviews/pynchon-luddite. html) by Thomas Pynchon for the New_York Times (1984).\n\n[Money in the Bank](https://www. jacobinmag. com/2014/08/money-in-the-bank/) by Dan O'Sullivan for Jacobin. (Jacobin[.] a socialist mag so don't be surprised if you notice a little bit of bias here!).\n\n[A Plea for Culinary Modernism](https://www. jacobinmag. com/2015/05/slow-food-artisanal-natural-preservatives/) by Rachel Laudan for Jacobin.\n\n[Critical perspectives on Waluigi](https://theemptypage. wordpress. com/2013/05/20/critical-perspectives-on-waluigi/) - obviously this one[.] supposed to be humorous, and it is!\n\n[Cabinet magazine](http://www. cabinetmagazine. org/) also has fantastic articles, though they're not always related to theory/philosophy. There are more stories in the print edition so consider picking one up.\n\nThere[.] good stuff in [Guernica](https://www. guernicamag. com/) too.\n\nHope this helps!"}
