My Liberal Arts program required an undergrad thesis so I shopped around for an interesting computational project I could work on.  I talked with profs from CS, Economics, and Biology, and the Biology projects looked waaaay more interesting, and the Bio profs were super supportive.  They had me sit in on a grad level systematics seminar, and I worked on comparing automated 16S rRNA alignments to a large, hand-curated alignment.\n\nScience hadn't totally hooked me at that point.  I got a coding job at a military intelligence contractor but also stayed on at the bio lab as a volunteer programr.  Over the course of a year I realized that my job was insanely boring and wasn't going to improve, but my bio work was awesome, and I couldn't get enough of it.  So I decided to quit my job and go to grad school for something bio related hoping that I'd end up in a career that I actually enjoyed.\n\nMy grad school work was evenly divided between molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and evolutionary analysis of protein/RNA sequence and structure.  Now I work at a small bioinformatics startup developing tools for bio lab sample tracking, data analysis, and reporting (kind of a combined LIMS/pipeline system).  It was a long and meandering journey, but now I'm solidly entrenched in the bioinformatics world and plan to remain."}
