So far, in most cases, they can't.  My craft involves understanding and predicting human response to images, cultural backstory, emotion, sound, and music.  I manage human expectations, and thwart them, then satisfy them. I drop subconscious cultural references that are felt, but not overtly duplicated. My job is to play human beings like a pipe organ, where some of the levers diddle primal instincts, and some make a joke about something 2 days old from Reddit. There is no outsourcing that cultural dexterity and there certainly is no software plug-in that can get that right. \n\nBots can and will make \"cool\" art. They will make things that are beautiful. They won't make things that are subversively meaningful. They won't do investigative journalism. They won't sing from the heart. They won't illustrate children[.] books anytime soon, compose soundtracks, or direct films. They will take STEM jobs before they take songwriters' jobs."}
