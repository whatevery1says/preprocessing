(Then I came back to U of T, haha). \n\n(ik UofT has it[.] bullshit ~C average in first year, but the average isn't my concern\n\nIt should be. If you're above average in your classes, you're above average. If you're at average, you're at average.\n\nI am a PhD student and the students in my program had a massive variety of undergraduate experiences. Some aced their degrees, others did very poorly. We all ended up in the same program. There are multiple ways to get where you want to go other than the straight line, and you'll find as you go through life that the majority of the group did take an unconventional route. \n\nYour more than 2h commute is not good. Consider moving to a closer location. \n\nDo you even have enough time to get enough sleep, have a good social life, get a high GPA and leave some room for hobbies?\n\nThat[.] a lot to try for. I would shoot for good GPA, some socialising, a hobby and reasonable sleep. Sleep, especially. Sleeping is incredibly important to successful studying. "}
