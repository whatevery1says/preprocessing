College is 20 years ago for me.  I have heard him speak on MPR.  I have absolutely no interest in reading literary theory at this point in my life.  In college, he was definitely someone who turned me off from being an English Major and made literary criticism seem foolish and a joyless pursuit that ruins the joy of reading. I have been on reddit for  3 months approximately and I have never used twitter.  You should probably stop making assumptions about people to make irrelevant attacks on who you think their character is.  It doesn't help your argument or the discussion any.  \n\nYou do not need to read even 1 literary critic to enjoy literature or reading.  I don't understand what essential means other than crucial, extremely important or absolutely necessary.  He is not essential if you are interested in literature or writing.  Many many people have exist just fine without knowledge of him or his ideas and still enjoy literature. He might be \"essential\" for academia but that is an entirely different thing.  It absolutely does stink that he is well regarded in academia because then he ends up getting interviewed in the press and then us plebes have to hear his opinions and then he reinforces the poor opinion people have of liberal_arts."}
