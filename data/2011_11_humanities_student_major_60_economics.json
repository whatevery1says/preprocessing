Benefits, retirement, the works.\n\nOn the other hand... the person that sits to her right and the person that sits to her left are *english majors*. In fact, according to her, people with degrees in the humanities are the majority in her office, but they all work as programrs. Those that didn't study computer science in school just picked up the skill on their own, sold themselves well enough to get an interview and then sold themselves well enough to get a job.\n\nWhen the economy is down, you have to make the extra effort to show that you are the_right person. Bachelors degrees are essentially a check mark anyway. Develop real skills that are needed in the job market and then put them to use... don't rely on professors to do that for you.\n\nI'm not in any way trying to imply that people without jobs are somehow without skills or unable to contribute to the economy. In an ideal world, everyone can play to their skills and interests. It would be great to have an economic structure that reflected that... but the reality now is that the competition is high and you need to make sure that you are the_right *person* for the job, not that you have the_right degree."}
