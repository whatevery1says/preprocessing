A lot of papers are not offered for a variety of reasons - the most common being the lecturer is on study leave. However the poster on the Facebook page has discounted this:\n\nTo all those suggesting [.]abbaticals' are responsible -\n\n Do you know the meaning of the word 'ludicrous'? English courses seem to have been cut, so it[.] okay if you don't. Are you sure the Arts students, McDonald[.]-bound as we are, are dumb enough to believe that a vast variety of lecturers on various completely unrelated disciplines all decided to take a sabbaticals? I'm pretty sure that[.] what 'ludicrous' means.\n\n It'd be believable, if you know, you could believe that lecturers are capable of fucking thousands of students over, you know? We're Arts students though, we're used to it. Lecturers take sabbaticals, we're aware. But in this number? I don't think so.\n\nPersonally I believe its just the combination of many lecturers taking study leave, a few courses being cut (either a lecturer leaves, or the course is not popular). Its then been exaggerated to the extreme by this facebook page. \n\nHowever, if I'm wrong and there have been mass cuts of popular papers for financial reasons then its a pretty sad day indeed.\n\nEdit: Also there are new papers being offered as well that were not available last year.
