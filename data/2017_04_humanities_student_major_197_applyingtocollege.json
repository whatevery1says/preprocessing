Excellent faculty and quality of education. Lots of eclectic minds and driven students. Very high quality education.\n\nCon... because the campus is truly *in* NYC, it doesn't feel like a college campus. It feels more like a connection of buildings that just happen to be for the same school. The buildings are also pretty grimy on the inside as grit gets tracked in from the streets. If you aren't familiar with how to handle interactions with homeless people, you should learn. There are quite a few regulars that hang out around campus. Because of security concerns, you *must* have your student ID to access any building on the campus. There are literal security guards or NYPD officers at every entrance which should make people feel safe... it doesn't. It[.] also a tough environment if you are a female outside of the Arts. I'm not sure why, but non-Arts subject matters tend to have a bit of a bro culture. It[.] also very expensive to attend NYU and they are not known for giving generous financial aid. Make sure you can afford to go there.\n\n\nI know this looks like the cons outweighs the pros. It is true that the con list is longer, but a lot of them are not a big deal to a lot of students. "}
