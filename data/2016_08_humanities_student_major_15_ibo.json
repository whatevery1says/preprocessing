Not really. For someone in the US going into IB in a month, not at all. \n\nThe gist of it is, you take 3 **HLs** (*Higher Level courses in subjects you are good at and have a passion for*), 3 **SLs** (*Standard Level courses you may not be so great at*) in 6 different subject **Groups**: *English* (I), *Foreign Language* (II), *Humanities/Social Studies* (III), *Science* (IV), *Math* (V), and *Arts* (VI)/another one of the other 5. You also have to do **EE** (*Extended Essay*), **TOK** (*Theory of Knowledge*), and **CAS** (*Service oriented extra-cirriculars that focus on* **Creativity**, **Action**, *and* **Service**). In each of your 6 classes you write an essay called an *Internal Assessment* (**IA**) or a variation of an **IA** depending on your subject, and take 2-3 **Papers** depending on the subject and difficulty level. You're given a score out of 7 for each subject based on your exams and **IA**s. Some **HLs** and *Science* classes require you to take a third \"*Option*\" exam in which you decide the subject in which you will be tested on. **EE** and **TOK** are graded and combined to give you a score out of 3. These 7 numbers are added together to give you your *IB score*. If you get over a 24, get above a 3 in each of your **HL**s, get at least one point in **EE** and **TOK**, and complete **CAS**, you get your ***IB Diploma***. \n\nWow this is complicated now that I've written it all down...\n\nEDIT: Changed *Community* to *Creativity*. Sorry, this was right as I was going to bed."}
