There are many departments within SAS that do work closely with the SAS honors program, but these are generally humanities focused. The impact it will have for CS is very very minimal. For the most part it will just seem like extra humanities requirements added on to your general SAS requirements.\n\nThe main benefit that those in the honors program get are special honors sections for certain classes which are much smaller(~10 people). That said, CS honors sections are usually very rare, and are usually just part of the normal lectures.\n\nFor research, your best bet is talking to professors and the CS department directly. Also going through programs like [ARESTY](https://aresty. rutgers. edu/) will be more useful. Going by the SAS honors site, they encourage research but simply point you to ARESTY (which you do not have to be in the honors program to apply to).\n\nFor jobs and internships, the SAS Honors might make your transcript look a little better to some recruiters, but IMO this is does not really make an impact. As long as you do well in your classes you will be at no disadvantage to other students. Besides, this is really only good to get your foot in the door at most places. Many companies will value interviews and the work you do outside of class far more than whether you were in the Honors program or not (and in a lot of cases, more than grades in general)."}
