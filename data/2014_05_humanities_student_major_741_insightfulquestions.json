S. not sure if you'd like to be scared about the humanities outlook, but i can do that for you. i came out of a pretty highly-regarded undergrad program in my field, and the only long_term prospect that my training distinctly prepared me for was a professorship. even with letters from well-known faculty members it took two cycles (that is, two years) of applications to get into a top-20 phd program, each of which accepts about ten students a year out of a pool of 200-300 applicants. attrition is almost 50% during the program, and graduates in good standing get a tenure track placement (the desired outcome) about 50% of the time.\n\ni had room at my university for two majors and two minors, and if i had to make a recommendation, i'd tell you the same thing i tell my students: i really do believe you can get a lot out of studying the humanities, but this is something to minor/get a ceritificate in/take courses on the side in, not something to try to do as a living. with a modest amount of undergraduate training, anyone can read scholarly work in history, philosophy, lit crit, what have you. if you can secure a stable, well-paying job in another field and read the literature as a hobbyist, you can have all the benefits (whatever they are, and however dubious you or others may be of them) of studying the humanities without--if everything goes *right*!--5-7 years pursuing a phd, 2-3 years as a post doc or nigh-adjunct faculty member, and 6-10 years trying to get tenure. even for the very elite few who go undergrad-grad-postdoc-tenure track, it[.] still well over a decade living at or below the poverty line, often while accruing debt. again, in the pretty much best case scenario, you're 37, tenured, living wherever you were hired (think satellite campus of a state university system) now making something like $70K. unless you *have* to be in academia, it[.] just not worth it.\n\njust as an illustrative example, a good friend of mine from college was a C student. he majored in econ, got a job in finance, and is making $60-70K at 24. he[.] moving into a beautiful apartment in a cool city, just bought a new car, has lots of freedom to pursue his passions, and no debt. by contrast i'll be splitting an apartment at least two ways to live within my means, my primary mode of transportation will probably be foot/bicycle, and between my coursework and teaching duties i'll probably have very little in the way of free time. i won't say one or the other of us is better off, but maybe one path appeals to you more."}
