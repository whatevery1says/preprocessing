So, where is the personal responsibility of the lenders?  Oh that[.] right, they managed to get legislation past to prevent people from having these debts removed in bankruptcy so now the sky is the limit on how much tuition can cost and how big the loans can be.  These loans were predatory on kids!  I'm sorry but I have no sympathy for the lenders or the schools who raked in massive amounts of money at the expense of making kids grossly indebted to the point of ruining their lives.  Most of these people would pay the loans back if they could but more and more can't and we are not talking about just liberal_arts majors, we are talking about school teachers and even engineers who don't make enough money to pay back their loans.  If I was in their situation, I would be looking at ways to either leave the country and avoid these debts or simply suicide.  Let the lenders and colleges with their sky high tuition prices crash and burn.  Also, if a student says \"I want to get a liberal_arts degree who is going to give me $100k to get it?\"  Who is really at fault here?  The kid or the lending agent or the school offering the degree for such a high cost?  I don't know about you, but, I would put the blame on the lender and the school and not the kid.  "}
