I work in stem education with a lot of really bright and nerdy high school students. \n\nEspecially when people are considering majors without a defined job path after college like arts. \n\nWhen discussing possible subjects to study in college and their value I zero in on this idea when it comes to stem vs. liberal_arts or other subjects. \n\nYes, if you study outside of stem and a few other majors your career will most likely be much less defined. Does that mean that you cannot make a living, be a professional/have a career, and be happy? Of coarse not. I think it[.] more that your career will not look like a *traditional* career (working at a company, mon-fri 9-5, benefits, Christmas parties, etc) and you should not expect it to do so. You will most likely have multiple different ventures, collaborations, and projects, going at once and will really have to have some kickass networking skills. \n\nHonestly, many people prefer that type of a career to to a traditional looking one. I kind of fall in the middle as a teacher but I can tell you I would NOT do well in a traditional office or company environment. \n\nAlso I went to a very stem oriented university and I know a ton of unemployed comp sci and engineering majors in a tech hub city with low unemployment.
