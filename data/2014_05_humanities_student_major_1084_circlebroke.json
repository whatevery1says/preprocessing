It seems like every week there is a post mocking people for discouraging students from pursuing the liberal_arts. Well, if you drift into college without a plan and end up on the five year track without much in the way of hard skills... you end up on reddit blaming boomers. \n\nGoing into debt to obtain a generic BA cannot be justified. Sure, if you go to Harvard, or Princeton, you can go work in consulting or Wall Street with a BA in comparative literature (this is what Michael Lewis did). \n\nBut attending an expensive private school that isn't Ivy League to study history? That is a monumental waste of four years and tens of thousands of dollars. Accounting, engineering, nursing, etc., vocational career tracks, are still a safe bet (but nothing is sure anymore). \n\nI work in construction -- and I just recently hired a guy, about my age, who has an MA in history from a very highly regarded school, to dispatch trucks and wash equipment.
