Granted, most of their faculty is adjunct/part-time, and paid and treated poorly, but at least these adjuncts are mostly professionals in the field they teach. Also, most of their general education/liberal_arts classes are a joke unless they're at least 2000 level and/or honors, but as an art school, it excels at most of the niches it fits (also, for some reason, most of the math/science profs have PHDs, though Columbia offers no more than a minor for this field).\n\nIts film, photography, print-making, book-and-paper arts, and industrial design programs/facilities are top notch. Its game design program is a joke, but so was DePaul[.] when it was just started. I suspected that its anthropology program (\"cultural studies\") was lacking until a friend of mine got a Field Museum internship and then accepted into Teach for America. One of my favorite lecturers at UIC, who taught two of my classes, actually went to Columbia for his undergrad. (I switched from UIC to Columbia.) The Chronicle[.] content also consistently receives Illinois College Press Awards every year. And, unbelievably, every single fiction writing major I know has a job in the field. I'll be the first to tell you that the fiction writing department is very negligent of literary theory/criticism, and so should have all the appearance of a lack of academic rigor, but... there you go. It somehow gets you a job."}
