I know it feels good getting brownie points from pakistanis (of all), but thankfully reality is different.\n\n\nA lot of Indians support freedom for Kashmiris. Just go to any liberal_arts college or someone who knows history. Just ask any liberal in r/india (not the_right_wingers, though some right_wingers like bhiliyam support Kashmiris too). Of course, it'd be living in denial if I say that we are a majority. We are a minuscule minority (less than 0. 1%, i would say). 80% of Indians are not even aware that half of Kashmir is not with us and is controlled by Pakistan. Most Indians are too busy getting on with their daily lives rather than worry about Kashmir. \n\npakistanis (of all)\n\nTrue. Pakistanis are not human beings. Why would anyone even think of sullying themselves in their sub and actually supporting them in some issues.\n\nPlus for the benefit of all our friends here and yourself, you don't need to be a \"right_wing fundamentalist\" to say J&K is an integral part of India. Just an Indian who respects his/her constitution\n\nOne needs to have some basic sense of humanity and history before being a chest thumping nationalist. I don't support a lot of things in my constitution. I don't support anti-LGBT laws, lack of privacy laws and dozens of other stupid laws. Constitution is written by human beings. I don't need to respect it. "}
